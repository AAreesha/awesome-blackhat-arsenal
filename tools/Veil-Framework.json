  "Description": "The Veil-Framework is an open source project that aims to bridge the gap between pen-testing and red team toolsets. It began with Veil-Evasion, a tool to generate AV-evading payload executables, expanded into payload delivery with the release of Veil-Catapult, and branched into Powershell functionality with the release of Veil-PowerView for domain situational awareness. This Arsenal presentation will cover the inner workings of all of these tools, and demonstrate various use cases where the Veil-Framework can help facilitate engagements."
