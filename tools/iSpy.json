  "Description": "Frustrated with the lack of mature tools for iOS security assessment?  Wouldnât you like an integrated toolchain to pull together many of the existing tools, but also integrate new and interesting tools? Perhaps youâd like to use some more advanced iOS hacking/reversing/debugging but donât have time on the job to learn gdb.  Maybe you just want to pick up iOS hacking fast and would like a mature toolchain to help you."
