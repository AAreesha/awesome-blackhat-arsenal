  "Description": "NFC Scrambler is an android app that emulates a rfid card to prevent nfc skimming. Rfid cards are used nearly everywhere, either in the forms of identification cards or credit cards. RFID Skimming statistics reveal that every two seconds a new case of identity theft is reported in the United States; however, not everyone can afford a rfid blocker card or wallet. Thus this app will help them block rfid skimming for free."
