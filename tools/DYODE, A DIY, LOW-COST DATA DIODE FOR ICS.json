  "Description": "DYODE (Do Your Own Dyode) is a low cost, DIY data diode aimed at securing Industrial Control Systems. While data diodes have been used for a long time on classified networks, the high cost and complexity of implementation have kept them away from a lot of valid use cases on industrial control systems. During our assignments, we encountered many situations in which time nor availability constraints were very high - but the security risk was - and a commercial data diode was much too costly."
