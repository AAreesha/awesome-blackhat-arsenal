  "Description": "De-Cloak is designed to extract HTTP user agents from PCAP files and store known user agents in a database. Hackers often hide wget or http requests by using known user agents. However, if we change our own user agents (perhaps via a GPO) we can start to investigate what starts to stand out. Simple but effective."
