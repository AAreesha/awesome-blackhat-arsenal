  "Description": "JTAGulator is an open source hardware hacking tool that assists in identifying on-chip debug interfaces from test points, vias, or component pads on a circuit board. It currently supports the detection of JTAG and asynchronous serial/UART interfaces. The tool can save a tremendous amount of time during reverse engineering, particularly for those who don't have the skill and/or equipment required for traditional processes. Black Hat Arsenal Europe 2016 will mark the release of a new firmware version and Joe will provide demonstrations of the tool's expanded functionality."
