It allows developers to scan their C# and VB.net code for potential vulnerabilities directly from Visual Studio. The analyzers are able to find a wide range of vulnerabilities from injection flaws to cryptographic weaknesses. Example of vulnerable applications will be analyzed in a live demonstration."
