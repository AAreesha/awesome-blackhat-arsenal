  "Description": "It is of the utmost importance for any security engineer to understand their network first before securing it and it becomes a daunting task to have a 'true' understanding of a widespread network. In a mid to large level organisation's network having a network architecture diagram doesn't provide the complete understanding and manual verification is a nightmare. Hence in order to secure entire network it is important to have a complete picture of all the systems which are connected to your network.\n\nBOTTOM LINE - YOU CAN'T SECURE WHAT YOU ARE NOT AWARE OF.\n\nLet's Map Your Network (LMYN) aims to provide a easy to use interface to security engineer and network administrator to have their network in graphical form with zero manual error, where a node represents a system and relationship between nodes represent the connection. To achieve this it uses the basic network commands such as traceroute, ping scan etc.\n\nBelow are the modules in LMYN to perform the task of mapping\n\nProject Management – Two modules (New Project and Working Project) will allow you to create and switch between the different projects\n\nLoad CMDB - This module allows an administrator to upload the CMDB file (new line separated) and map it entirely. Additionally, it have a Be Intrusive feature which, if selected, will perform enumeration to identify the 'rogue' host that are not present in CMDB. RED color node will depicts the rogue nodes\n\nFind Me – This module enumerates the IP of system in which it is running and further network mapping will be done considering the current system as a 'seed'\n\nRoam Around – This module identifies all 'live' hosts in the same LAN in which seed system is connected\n\nGo To – This module displays graph of all hops that packet is traversing through to reach destination (provided by user) from seed system\n\nScan – This module will perform ping scan of any arbitrary IP range provided by user\n\nPresentation: https://github.com/varchashva/LetsMapYourNetwork/blob/master/docs/LetsMapYourNetwork_BlackHat.pdf\nSource Code: https://github.com/varchashva/LetsMapYourNetwork"
