  "Description": "Trape is a recognition tool that allows you to track people and make phishing attacks in real time; the information you can get is very detailed. The objective is to teach the world the possible outcomes through this strategy -- the big Internet companies could be monitoring you, getting information beyond your IP, such as the sessions of your sites or Internet services."
