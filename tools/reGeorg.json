  "Description": "In 2008, we released reDuh (http://research.sensepost.com/tools/web/reduh), a network-tunneling tool that allowed port forwarding via a web-shell and HTTP/S to backend services. reDuh has since become part of any attackers standard toolkit, featured in several books and notoriously described as \"insidious\" by HBGary in their leaked e-mails.\n\nHowever, when doing any sort of tunneling, targeting multiple hosts and ports can be frustrating as it requires a tunnel to be setup for each unique host:port combination. Enter reGeorg; this is a rewrite of reDuh to support a full SOCKS4/5 proxy interface. This allows one tunnel to be used to make multiple connections, including port scans. Additionally, capabilities to take advantage of HTML5 websockets (where available) have been built for faster connections.\n\nIn short, if you can get a webshell up, you can use reGeorg to gain access with your favorite tool (Nmap, Metasploit, etc.) to the entire internal network range your compromised server has access to.\n\nThe list of currently supported web frameworks are: ASP.NET, JSP, PHP, ASP. The list of currently supported transports are: HTTP, HTTPS, HTML5 WebSockets."
