  "Description": "TROMMEL sifts through embedded device files to identify potential vulnerable indicators. Specifically, TROMMEL identifies the following indicators:\n\nSecure Shell (SSH) key files\nSecure Socket Layer (SSL) key files\nInternet Protocol (IP) addresses\nUniform Resource Locators (URLs)\nEmail addresses\nShell scripts\nWeb server binaries\nConfiguration files\nDatabase files\nSpecific binaries files (for example, Dropbear, BusyBox, and others)\nShared object library files\nWeb application scripting variables\n\nAndroid application package (APK) file permissions\n\nTROMMEL integrates vFeed, to provide a custom intersection with Exploit-DB, Metasploit, Snort, and Nmap. This integration allows for further in-depth vulnerability analysis of identified indicators. All in all, TROMMEL significantly lessens the manual analysis time of the researcher by automating much of the vulnerability discovery and analysis process."
