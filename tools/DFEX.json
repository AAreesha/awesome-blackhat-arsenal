  "Description": "DFEX - [DNS File EXfiltration]\n\nData exfiltration is a common technique used for post-exploitation, DNS is one of the most common protocols through firewalls.\nWe take the opportunity to build a unique protocol for transferring files across the network.\n\nExisting tools have some limitations and NG Firewalls are getting a bit \"smarter\", we have been obliged to explore new combinations of tactics to bypass these. Using the good old fashion \"HIPS\" (Hidden In Plain Sigh) tricks to push files out."
