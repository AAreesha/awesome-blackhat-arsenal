  "Description": "MQTT is a machine-to-machine connectivity protocol designed as an extremely lightweight publish/subscribe messaging transport and widely used by millions of IoT devices worldwide.\n\nMQTT-PWN intends to be a one-stop-shop for IoT Broker penetration-testing and security assessment operations, as it combines enumeration, supportive functions and exploitation modules while packing it all within command-line-interface with an easy-to-use and extensible shell-like environment.\n\nBuilt-in abilities/modules:\n\nCredential Brute-Forcer - configurable brute force password cracking to bypass authentication controls\nTopic enumerator - establishing comprehensive topic list via continuous and accumulated sampling.\nBroker information grabber - obtaining and labeling data from an extensible predefined list containing known topics of interest, broker type and version and more\nGPS tracker - plotting routes from devices using OwnTracks app and collecting published coordinates, battery usage, connection method etc.\nSonoff exploiter â€“ design to extract passwords and other sensitive information off smart switches\n\nA full circle of scenarios of attack using the tool will be demonstrated."
