  "Description": "Kubernetes is today's most popular container orchestrator. But it's also a complex distributed system, with defaults tuned for usability rather than for security. More so, configuring Kubernetes correctly is not trivial. Failing to configure Kubernetes in a secure way exposes the applications running on it to imminent risk, regardless of how securely those application are built.\n\nWe recognized the need to assess the level of security of a Kubernetes cluster deployment, and built kube-hunter to be an extensible pentesting and risk assessment platform for Kubernetes environments. We contributed quite a few discovery and hunt techniques from the get-go, and will add more over time. Kube-hunter is also designed to be easily extended by the community. The full list is too long for 300 words and ever-growing. This is the list of newest tests:\nNewest Passive Tests (tests not making any change to the cluster):\n● Vulnerabilities hunter (added CVEs):\n○ CVE-2019-9512\n○ CVE-2019-9514\n○ CVE-2019-11247\n○ CVE-2019-11246\n○ CVE-2019-1002101\n● Hunt pods that have write access to host's /var/log. Potentially allows an attacker to read files on the host machine\n● Checks for default enabled capabilities in a pod\n\nNewest Active Tests (may perform state-changing actions on the cluster):\n● Checks for the possibility of running an ARP spoof attack from within a pod\n● Checks for the possibility for a malicious pod to compromise DNS requests of the cluster"
