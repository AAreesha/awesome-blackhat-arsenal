  "Description": "Objection is a runtime mobile exploration toolkit, powered by Frida. It was built with the aim of helping assess mobile applications and their security posture without the need for a jailbroken or rooted mobile device.\n\nThe project's name quite literally explains the approach as well, whereby runtime specific objects are injected into a running process and executed using Frida."
