  "Description": "Network Firewall configuration is difficult to automatize, vendor Firewalls have their own ways to configure Firewalls. Assimilator wraps all vendor Firewalls into one JSON REST api; from here we can easily automatize ( i.e: Python with Requests) policy configuration and route/rule lookup."
