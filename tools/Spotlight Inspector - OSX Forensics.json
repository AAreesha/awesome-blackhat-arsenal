  "Description": "Spotlight Inspector is a free application for computer forensic investigation of Mac OS X computers. Until now, there has never been an effective cross-platform forensics tool for accessing Spotlight internal data from Mac OS X systems â which is where all of the information about files indexed on a computer can be accessed by forensic investigators. This information gathering is crucial to digital investigators."
