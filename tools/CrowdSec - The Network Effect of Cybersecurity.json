CrowdSec analyzes visitor behavior & provides an adapted response to all kinds of attacks. The solution also enables users to protect each other. Each time an IP is blocked, all community members are informed, so they can also block it. Already used in 160+ countries, the solution builds a crowd-sourced CTI database to secure individuals, companies, institutions etc. The recent release of CrowdSec Security Engine 1.5 brings new features to the table:\n- Polling API Integration\n- Real-time decisions management\n- New Blocklist API and Premium Blocklists\n- Kubernetes audit acquisition\n- S3 audit acquisition\n- Auditd support\n- CrowdSec CTI API helpers\n- AWS Cloudtrail Scenarios"
