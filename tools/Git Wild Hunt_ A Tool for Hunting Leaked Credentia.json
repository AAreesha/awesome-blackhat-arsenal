Git Wild Hunt searches for footprints and patterns of over 38 of the most used secrets/credentials on the internet, especially those used in Devops and IT Operations. This tool helps developers and security operation departments discover leaked credentials in public repositories. This tool is also a recon tool for red teamers and pentesters, as it also provides metadata from leaks such as usernames, company names, secret types, and dates."
