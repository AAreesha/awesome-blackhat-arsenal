As any tool of this type, it requires some basic knowledge and expertise in the matter, even though Exploit Pack has been designed to be used by hands-on security professionals to support their testing process, with a little bit of effort anyone can start using the core features of Exploit Pack to test in-deep the security of their applications. But of course some Exploit Pack's more advanced features will take further learning and experience to master."
