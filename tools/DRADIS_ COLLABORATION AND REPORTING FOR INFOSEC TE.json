Started in 2007, the Dradis Framework project has been growing ever since (15,000 commits in the last 12 months). Dradis is the best tool to consolidate the output of different scanners, add your manual findings and evidence and have all the engagement information in one place.\n\nCome to see the latest Dradis release in action. It's loaded with updates including new tool, connectors (Metasploit, Brakeman, ...), full REST API coverage, testing methodologies and lots of interface improvements (issue tagging, UX improvements and much more). Come and find out why Dradis is being downloaded over 300 times every week. Come and check it out before we run out of stickers!"
