  "Description": "Even for a big incident response team handling all of the repetitive tasks related to malware infections is a tedious task. Early on, we automated some of the collection and analysis using our own open source OSXCollector. This helped us quickly identify suspicious domains, URLs and file hashes. But our approach to the analysis still required manual steps that was consuming lots of attention from malware responders.\n\nEnter automation: Further reducing the repetitive tasks will help you deal faster with the incident discovery, forensic collection and analysis, with fewer possibilities to make a mistake. We have turned our OSXCollector toolkit into AMIRA: Automated Malware Incident Response and Analysis service. AMIRA turns the forensic information gathered by OSXCollector into an actionable response plan, suggesting the infection source as well as suspicious files and domains requiring a closer look. Furthermore, we integrated AMIRA with our incident response platform, making sure that as little interaction as necessary is required from the analyst to trigger the collection of the forensic artifacts.\n\nThanks to that, the incident response team members can focus on what they excel at: finding the unusual patterns and discovering the novel ways that malware was trying to sneak into the corporate infrastructure."
