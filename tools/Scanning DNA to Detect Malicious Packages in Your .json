  "Description": "PackageDNA is an open-source tool, free and modular tool developed in Python3, that offers developers and researchers the ability to analyze code packages from different programming languages, in search of vulnerabilities in the code, the possible manipulations or spoofing of the package ('typosquatting'), identifying suspicious files, searching for strings in the code, among other data for analysis.\n\nPackageDNA, enables threat intelligence analysis or code audits, which allow to detect attacks to the software supply chain, the vast majority of companies integrate third-party code in their developments, thus the need to have a suite such as PackageDNA that performs the analysis of all these external codes and delivers the results of the analysis in a standardized way."
