  "Description": "The Cat's Meow is a tool used during our penetration testing which analyzes the most common password scheme seen during our decoding and decryption stage of post exploitation. The tool reads in a password list of already obtained cleartext passwords and produces the most commonly seen Hashcat Masks which can then in turn be used to more quickly reverse other passwords."
