  "Description": "SquarePhish is an advanced phishing tool that uses a technique combining the OAuth Device code authentication flow and QR codes. Previous OAuth 2.0 Device Code phishing tools (like PhishInSuits) required a user open the phishing email and authenticate within 15 minutes of the email being sent. This drastically decreased the chances of a successful phish, as many emails expired prior to user interaction.\n\nSquarePhish fixes this issue, by decoupling the initial email from the OAuth Device Code flow. Combining this technique, QR Codes, and a Microsoft MFA pretext we are able to perform advanced phishing attacks.\n\nWe have also added a subtool called Rephresh that utilizes undocumented Microsoft functionality that allows the SquarePhish obtained tokens to be swapped out for tokens for other applications."
