  "Description": "As application, network, and product complexity grow, so do the attack surface and likelihood of vulnerabilities. Highly-skilled pen testers do not scale exponentially, and findings don't make it into secure coding practices or DevOps overnight.\n\nHow can we enable pen testers to focus on what matters: adversary-oriented penetration testing to detect the most difficult vulnerabilities and exploits? What correlations exist between successful exploits and underlying application or network characteristics? And how can we ensure findings actually make it back into the development lifecycle in a meaningful way?\n\nOur research, and Python-based VAPT framework seeks to address these questions, and automates certain tasks to assist pen testers:"
