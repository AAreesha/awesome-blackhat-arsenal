### [411: A FRAMEWORK FOR MANAGING SECURITY ALERTS](#)  
![BH-EU-17](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-EU-17-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
Modern web applications are noisy systems that generate enormous amounts of logging information. This information is valuable for debugging and for forensic reasons. Yet, sifting through this information is a daunting task, to say nothing of collecting it in the first case. Many teams have turned to suites like ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) to ingest and surface this treasure trove of information. It's a valuable resource for Security teams, provided they can surface this information in a timely manner. These were the constraints Etsy worked with in 2014. We needed a solution for generating alerts on top of ELK. This system should have the capability to inject additional context into alerts. There was no available solution at the time, so we built one.

We named this open-source framework 411. We designed 411 as a solution for detecting noteworthy security events, but it's a general useful alerting tool. Nor is it just limited to Elasticsearch, as we've built additional modules for pull data from other sources! This presentation assumes you have an ELK stack set up already. We'll show you some recommendations on logs to index in Elasticsearch. Examples will be provided of alerts that you can build off these logs. We'll demo some of the ways 411 can add context to alerts and the ways you can receive these alerts. Whether you're a newbie looking to learn more or a security veteran with an established system, 411 will be a valuable addition your toolkit.


### [.NET SECURITY GUARD](#)  
![BH-EU-16](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-EU-16-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
.NET Security Guard is a code analyzer using the brand new Roslyn API, a framework built to develop analyzers, refactoring tools and build tools. It allows developers to scan their C# and VB.net code for potential vulnerabilities directly from Visual Studio. The analyzers are able to find a wide range of vulnerabilities from injection flaws to cryptographic weaknesses. Example of vulnerable applications will be analyzed in a live demonstration.


### [2FASSASSIN](#)  
![BH-EU-17](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-EU-17-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
There are many ways to steal someone's private keys without performing social engineering attacks. This talk is dedicated to discussing and demonstrating the newly discovered techniques to bypass the two-factor authentication by stealing and cracking OTP, private keys, and client certificates. By that means, an attacker must compromise the voice or text message accounts, software token, infecting memory agents, cracking passphrase, stealing hardware token, etc. 2FAssassin could turn these looted keys for more fun and profits. The demonstration will include the scenario where the private keys are compromised and then show how an attacker could leverage the situation to gain more access into the corporate networks, as well as making profits. These are not limited to systems that used single sign-on (with 2FA enabled), public key authentication (e.g., password-less authentication, authorized_keys abuse), free software token (e.g., Google Authenticator), website owner (e.g., phishing sites created using stolen private key), and even software vendors (e.g., stolen private key can be used to sign the malicious malware). 2FAssassin will automate the exploitations against the common vulnerabilities that lead to the private key leakage. It can be used to compromise individual system, or the entire network using looted private keys. It also capable to analyze and identify potential private keys from a pool of gathered files, critical key information extraction in order to identify and validate the target domain, cracking and removing the passphrase, injecting arbitrary key-based backdoors to all accessible machines, building multi-chained covert tunnels by leveraging on the loopholes found in vulnerable public key authentication, sign the malware with looted private key followed by automatic bulk distribution, generate phishing site, ... etc, and many many more exciting functionalities.


### [A Black Path Toward The Sun](#)  
![BH-US-16](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-US-16-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
Web application servers and appliances are often one of the most highly-visible entry points into an organization or high-security network. If the server is misconfigured or hosting vulnerable code, existing tools can frequently be used by attackers to convert it into a gateway to the internal network. However, taking full advantage of such a system typically requires a network-level connection between the attacker and the web application server. For example, an internet-facing Linux web application server may have network-level connectivity to an internal Windows domain controller, but appropriate client tools may not function correctly when used via a web shell or similar interface. An interactive session (SSH, RDP, et cetera) on the vulnerable system, or port-forwarding to allow direct connectivity to internal services from the attacker's system becomes necessary. If the organization responsible for the server has done everything else correctly (including blocking tunneling via ICMP/DNS), then there may be no additional network-level connectivity possible in either direction between the attacker and the web application server. This closes off SSH, RDP, and similar interactive remote access, and prevents the use of port-forwarding agents such as Meterpreter.This presentation provides a solution to this problem - A Black Path Toward The Sun, a tool (released as open source in conjunction with the presentation) which tunnels TCP traffic through the web application server using the server's existing HTTP/HTTPS interface. That is, a JSP/WAR/ASPX file is deployed on the server (just as a web shell would be), and a Python script is executed on the attacker's system which performs TCP port-forwarding through that deployed server-side component. The tool also incorporates novel measures to make the network communication challenging to detect using traditional IDS/IPS/WAF-type systems. Java/JSP and ASP.NET editions of the server-side component will be included in the initial open source release, but porting the component to other web application servers should be straightforward.


### [A DECEPTICON and AUTOBOT walk into a bar: A NEW Python tool for enhanced OPSEC](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
When we see the terms Natural Language Processing (NLP) or Machine Learning (ML), often, our guts are correct, and it is vendor marketing material, frequently containing FUD. After tinkering with various libraries in Python and R with the use of some OSINT and SOCMINT techniques, I have found a use for NLP and ML that is 100% FUD free in the form of a brand new, Python-based tool.

In this presentation, which goes further than the previous DECEPTICON presentation, we address topics that I have frequently spoken about in past years is disinformation, deception, OSINT, and OPSEC. When working through learning NLP and ML in Python, it dawned on me: marry these technologies with DECEPTICON for good. Enter the DECEPTICON bot. The DECEPTICON bot is a python* based tool that connects to social media via APIs to read posts/tweets to determine patterns of posting intervals and content then takes over to autonomously post for the user. What is the application you ask: people who are trying to enhance their OPSEC and abandon social media accounts that have been targeted without setting off alarms to their adversaries. Use case scenarios include public figures, executives, and, most importantly – domestic violence and trafficking victims.


### [A Privilege Rules-Based Vulnerabilities Scan Tool for Android Apps](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
In the development of software, the system is often designed on a good architecture to ensure the security of the system, which reduces the risk of being attacked. However, due to business requirements, some "privilege rules" often exist in some key security protection processes, such as some privilege userid lists, privilege url lists, or special paths, etc. These privilege configurations disrupt the original security process, and pull down the security level, become a new attack surface (intrusion into the original secure system through attack privilege rules). It is more difficult for us to attack the system directly, but it will be easier to attack the system through the vulnerabilities in the privilege rules, and even the vulnerabilities in these privilege rules already exist widely.

Because of the above attack risks, we develope a tool called "privilege rules bug hunter"(PBH) to detect the vulnerability of privilege rules in software. Data flow graph (DFG) and Control flow graph(CFG) enable us to better understand the inherent logic in software. However, there are so many control flows and data flows when identifying the privilege rules. How to distinguish the normal logic and find out the privilege rules accurately is a challenge. We will combine DFG, CFG and taint analysis methods to find out the risk: 1) generate a graph with the help of DFG and CFG , and use graph similarity information to classify. 2) The software is tested dynamically by online data, and the path information of runtime is recorded by hook to help identify the privilege paths of the graph in 1). 3) Collecting the information of privilege rules and looking for common vulnerabilities(such as xss etc) to reache the control of the whole system.

In this talk, we found the risk of privilege rules in a software , which broke the normal flow of software security architecture and introduce new risks. At the same time, based on the software analysis method, a tool is implemented to detect the vulnerability of privilege rules. We use the developed tool in Android Software Security testing, and find many privilege URLs and paths are configured into the software with high permissions. At the same time, there are a large number of n-days in the websites where these URLs exist.


### [AARDVARK AND REPOKID](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
Amazon AWS provides a tool called "Access Advisor" that shows unused permissions for a given IAM role. Access advisor data can be very valuable for security practitioners as it shows unused permissions that can be removed to harden the environment and promote least privilege best practices.

In the past retrieving Access Advisor information and reclaiming unused permissions has been a tedious and manual process involving logging in to the console and making changes by hand. Aardvark and Repokid are two complementary tools that make this process easy and automatable. Aardvark automatically retrieves access advisor for all roles in all accounts in your environment and exposes it as a queryable API. Repokid uses data presented by Aardvark to enable automatic role right-sizing.

Used together, Aardvark and Repokid can ensure roles retain only the necessary privileges, even in large dynamic AWS deployments.


### [ACE (AUTOMATED COLLECTION AND ENRICHMENT PLATFORM)](#)  
![BH-EU-17](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-EU-17-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
Many expensive Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) tools are available, but the high cost and effort required to deploy agents to every host can be off-putting to companies. The Automated Collection and Enrichment (ACE) Platform is an open source solution that enables agentless threat hunting in an environment. This tool makes it possible for anyone to begin gathering otherwise difficult to collect host data to hunt for threats in their environment.

As consultants performing Compromise Assessments, we rarely have the authority or ability to alter a customer's environment to support assessment operations. Actions like enabling Windows Remote Management (WinRM) can require levels of bureaucracy and take months to accomplish. It is also difficult to answer questions surrounding systems running MacOS and Linux. By removing a few of our assumptions, we created ACE, an ASP.NET Web Application that not only allows the scanning of Windows and MacOS machines, but also provides scan management with features like Credential Management, Scan Tracking, and File Downloading.

In addition to running scripts and collecting scan data, ACE provides a robust enrichment and ingestion pipeline. Users can easily create individual enrichments in ACE to integrate their favorite data sources, such as hash lookups, IP reputation, sandboxing. The enrichment details can be integrated with original results to create the finalized data types in one object. With a final enrichment, the robust data set can be sent directly to a waiting SIEM for analysis. We supply an ELK docker image which will automatically ingest data collected by ACE. ACE provides an easy and customizable solution for threat hunters to gather and enrich data before it ever reaches the SIEM, enabling more advanced analysis.


### [ACT: Semi-Automated Cyber Threat Intelligence](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
ACT is an open-source threat intelligence platform that has been built from the ground up to address the real-world needs of security analysts, incident responders and threat researchers across all industries. The platform is the product of a 3-year collaborative research project between the private sector, security agencies, CERTs and universities.


ACT enables advanced threat enrichment, threat analysis, visualisation, process automation, lossless information sharing and powerful graph analysis. Its modular design and APIs facilitate implementing new workers for enrichment, analysis, information sharing, and countermeasures.


Included in the platform is Scio, a component that ingests human-readable reports, like threat advisories and blog posts, and uses natural language processing and pattern matching to extract structured threat information to import to the platform. Our Github repositories also include support for information import and data enrichment from MISP, MITRE ATT&CK, VirusTotal, PassiveDNS, ShadowServer and Splunk, with more on the way.


So why build yet another threat intelligence platform?
In 2014 we set out to find a platform on the market to meet the needs of our SOC and threat intelligence team. Our requirements were not particularly unique: we needed a platform that would help us to collect and organise our knowledge of threats, facilitate analysis and sharing, and make it easy to retrieve that knowledge when needed. We spent too much time on manual processes, copy-pasting information between different systems. Much of our knowledge was in an unstructured form, like threat reports, that made it difficult and time consuming to figure out if we had relevant knowledge that could help us decide how to handle security alerts and security incidents.


Sound familiar? After evaluating the existing platforms, we concluded they could not easily be adapted to meet our requirements. In speaking with our partners, customers and the security community, we saw we were not alone and decided to research and develop a new platform: ACT.


This session will focus on threat analysis using the GUI to demonstrate how ACT can help SOC analysts, incident responders and threat analysts/hunters/researchers.

### [ADA: Android Dynamic Analysis Tool](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
ADA analyzes the dynamic behavior of an Android application in runtime. ADA discovers the attack surface that is not shown during the static analysis and performs a rapid vulnerability assessment of the application.

ADA discovers the best attack path to follow to compromise the application. The automated dynamic analysis is focused on discovering the security measures implemented in the application. In this way, ADA shows the best attack path to compromise the application. Some of the features that ADA detects are whether the application uses certificate pinning, JNI libraries, SQL database discovery, KeyStores identification, hardware-backed KeyStore (TEE), etc.

### [AISY: A Framework for Deep Learning-Based Side-Channel Analysis](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
Profiling side-channel attacks (SCA) allow evaluators to verify the worst-case security scenario of their products. Nowadays, deep learning has become the state-of-the-art method for profiling SCA as deep neural networks show the ability to learn side-channel leakages from protected implementations. While deep learning is a powerful technique for security evaluations, it offers numerous possibilities for neural network configurations and optimization techniques. Selecting the best setup for each evaluated product is far from trivial and requires expertise in SCA and deep learning fields. To improve SCA methods, and at the same time to be able to investigate the resistance of the product to more complex attack scenarios, researchers continuously propose new techniques.
Unfortunately, several obstacles are making the acceptance of such techniques a challenge. Security evaluators from the industry face difficulties following up on new promising methods. What is more, certification bodies also must be aware of new SCA techniques to issue the certifications. Indeed, one of the main issues is the lack of publicly available, easy-to-use frameworks that allow powerful and reliable side-channel analysis. Moreover, due to the absence of the uniformed evaluation/implementation method, the reproducibility of the outcomes is not easy to ensure.

We propose AISY as a tool to allow state-of-the-art deep learning-based SCA. AISY is a python-based open-source framework, and it provides state-of-the-art functionalities for profiling SCA with easy usage, extensibility, reproducibility, integrated database, and user interface. We envision a system where the user can efficiently run the attacks with few lines of code and based on state-of-the-art but also extend those functionalities to support new developments. AISY supports the complete development cycle for deep learning-based SCA: from dataset preparation to the automated development of new models and their assessment concerning the side-channel metrics.


### [AKTAION V2 - A MACHINE LEARNING OPEN-SOURCE & ACTIVE DEFENSE (ORCHESTRATION) TOOL](#)  
![BH-EU-17](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-EU-17-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
Aktaion is a machine learning open source & active defense (orchestration) tool. The tool focuses on the detection of ransomware-based on machine learning techniques, independent of static-based signatures. The tool has been mentioned and featured in may respected community publications and research. On AKTAION v2, we decided to expand our approach utilizing the blending of multiple signals which we call micro behaviors to expand tool detection into PHISHING URI/URL attack delivery.


### [AMIRA: AUTOMATED MALWARE INCIDENT RESPONSE AND ANALYSIS FOR MACOS](#)  
![BH-EU-16](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-EU-16-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
Even for a big incident response team handling all of the repetitive tasks related to malware infections is a tedious task. Early on, we automated some of the collection and analysis using our own open source OSXCollector. This helped us quickly identify suspicious domains, URLs and file hashes. But our approach to the analysis still required manual steps that was consuming lots of attention from malware responders.

Enter automation: Further reducing the repetitive tasks will help you deal faster with the incident discovery, forensic collection and analysis, with fewer possibilities to make a mistake. We have turned our OSXCollector toolkit into AMIRA: Automated Malware Incident Response and Analysis service. AMIRA turns the forensic information gathered by OSXCollector into an actionable response plan, suggesting the infection source as well as suspicious files and domains requiring a closer look. Furthermore, we integrated AMIRA with our incident response platform, making sure that as little interaction as necessary is required from the analyst to trigger the collection of the forensic artifacts.

Thanks to that, the incident response team members can focus on what they excel at: finding the unusual patterns and discovering the novel ways that malware was trying to sneak into the corporate infrastructure.


### [ANDROID DEVICE TESTING FRAMEWORK V.13](#)  
![BH-EU-15](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-EU-15-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
The Android Device Testing Framework ("dtf") project started back in 2014 as a collection of scripts and utilities that aimed to help individuals answer the question: "Where are the vulnerabilities on this mobile device?" Since then, dtf has grown into a robust and extensive data collection and analysis framework with over 30 modules that allow testers to obtain information from their Android device, process this information into databases, and then start searching for vulnerabilities (all without requiring root privileges). These modules help you focus on changes made to AOSP components such as applications, frameworks, system services, as well as lower-level components such as binaries, libraries, and device drivers. In addition, you'll be able to analyze new functionality implemented by the OEMs and other parties to find vulnerabilities.

![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
This tool automates the process of creating logon relations from MS Windows Security Events by showing a graphical relation among users domains, source and destination logons, session duration, who was logged on the systems in a given datetime, etc. It is able to integrate and provides different output modes such as CSV output, Neo4j, SQLite, Gephi and Graphviz.


### [ANWI (ALL NEW WIRELESS IDS) - THE £5 WIDS](#)  
![BH-EU-17](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-EU-17-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
ANWI is a new type of Wireless Intrusion Detection System which is based on a low cost Wi-Fi module (ESP8266) and can be deployed at the physical perimeter of the coverage area. It allows organizations that cannot afford expensive WIDS solutions to protect their networks at a fraction of the cost.

The physical size of the sensors is very small and they can be deployed around the perimeter without drawing attention to themselves. ANWI sensors can detect the most commonly used Wi-Fi attacks including Evil Twin, Jamming using de-authentication frames and send alerts to a central console. The central console can be configured to send email to the administrator upon receiving alerts from any of the configured sensors.

ANWI aims to fulfill the need of WIDS which is inexpensive yet can protect against most of the possible attacks. It is easy to setup and deploy and works on "fire and forget principle." Once the sensors have been configured, they can be deployed across the perimeter. The central console keeps monitoring the sensors and in case any of the sensors goes offline an alert is generated as well.

In case there is need for physical security alerts along with wireless IDS , Passive InfraRed sensor (PIR) can be used to provide alerts on motion detection at perimeter. ANWI is under active development and new features will be added on regular basis. The current production version includes all the above features.

### [AOP-Based Runtime Security Analysis Toolkit](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
We will release an open source runtime security analysis toolkit, aosanalyzer, for Android application. This tool is mainly used to find application security vulnerabilities and privacy leaks that are difficult to find by static APK analysis. The aosanalyzer uses aspect-oriented programming in security technology to insert code into critical paths of the application to record the runtime information (e.g., the stack trace, parameters, UI events, etc.), and then produces a report with security issues highlights. These critical paths are configurable and the aosanalyzer tool includes a default configuration. Developers and security researchers can observe the detailed runtime information of the application to find vulnerability and privacy leak issues without requiring any modification of the APK. Relying on this tool, we have discovered dozens of security vulnerabilities due to lack of parameter validation and privacy leaks issues.


### [APKiD: "PEiD" for Android Applications](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
APKiD is like "PEiD" for Android applications. It gives information on how an APK was built by fingerprinting compilers, packers, obfuscators, and protectors. The main idea behind the tool is to help provide context on how the APK was potentially built or changed after it was built. This is all context useful for attributing authorship and finding patterns.

Extracting information about how the APK was made, it can provide a lot of information to assess the healthiness of an Android application (e.g. malware or pirated). The framework is the combination of a bunch of Yara rules and Python wrappers that scan files within APKs. Mainly, APKiD unpacks files and explores AndroidManifest.xml, DEX and ELF files to match rules and offers results based on them. Between the 186 Yara rules, we can find 94 packers, 10 compilers and 16 obfuscators.

Features and detections:

Commercial and open-source obfuscators, packers, droppers and protectors
Anti-disassembly tricks, anti-emulation, anti-debugging APIs,...
Abnormalities in DEX structure
Compiler fingerprint potentially indicating re-packaged apps
Results in JSON format

![BH-EU-16](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-EU-16-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
AppMon is a runtime security testing & profiling framework for macOS, iOS and android apps. It is useful for mobile app penetration testers to validate the security issues report by a source code scanner by validating them by inspecting the API calls at runtime. You may use it for monitoring the app's overall activity during its runtime and focus on things that seem suspicious e.g. information leaks, insecure storage of credentials/secret tokens etc. or insecure implementation of crypto operations or just sniff app's network activity from HTTP to Bluetooth. You may either use one or many of the pre-written user-scripts or quickly learn to write your own scripts modify the app's functionality/logic in the runtime e.g. spoofing the DeviceID, spoofing the GPS co-ordinates, bypassing Apple's TouchID, bypassing root detection etc.

We shall demo the features of existing 4 core components: Sniffer, Intruder, Android Tracer & IPA Installer. If there any any additional development to the project we shall include its demo as well.

![BH-EU-16](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-EU-16-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
Nearly every penetration test begins the same way; run a NMAP scan, review the results, choose interesting services to enumerate and attack, and perform post-exploitation activities. What was once a fairly time consuming manual process, is now automated! Automated Penetration Testing Toolkit (APT2) is an extendable modular framework designed to automate common tasks performed during penetration testing. APT2 can chain data gathered from different modules together to build dynamic attack paths. Starting with a NMAP scan of the target environment, discovered ports and services become triggers for the various modules which in turn can fire additional triggers. Have FTP, Telnet, or SSH? APT2 will attempt common authentication. Have SMB? APT2 determines what OS and looks for shares and other information. Modules include everything from enumeration, scanning, brute forcing, and even integration with Metasploit. Come check out how APT2 will save you time on every engagement.


### [ARP Covert Channel Attacks by 8bit Microcomputer #2](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
Introduces a method of embedding information in the padding part of ARP and performing secret communication with only one small 8-bit microcomputer. The transmitter uses an 8-bit microcomputer called Atmega328P. A 10BASE-T Ethernet frame is generated using only the GPIO of the microcomputer without using a dedicated chip such as an Ethernet controller. By using this method, it is possible to perform a covert channel attack with a smaller and cheaper method than the conventional method.

![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
For over five years, the JTAGulator has been the de facto open source tool for identifying interfaces commonly used for hardware hacking, such as JTAG and UART, from a target product's test points, vias, component pads, or connectors. The tool bridges the gap between gaining physical access to circuitry and exploiting it, and can save a significant amount of effort compared to traditional reverse engineering processes. For the first time at Black Hat Arsenal, attendees will have the opportunity to play with the JTAGulator and a variety of real-world embedded devices in an informal, hands-on environment.

### [ART: Adversarial Robustness 360 Toolbox for Machine Learning Models](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
Adversarial attacks against machine learning systems have become an indisputable threat. Attackers can compromise the training of machine learning models by injecting malicious data into the training set (so-called poisoning attacks), or by crafting adversarial samples that exploit the blind spots of machine learning models at test time (so-called evasion attacks). These attacks have been demonstrated in a number of different application domains, including malware detection, spam filtering, visual recognition, speech-to-text conversion, and natural language understanding. Devising comprehensive defences against poisoning and evasion attacks by adaptive adversaries is still an open challenge.

We will present the Adversarial Robustness 360 Toolbox (ART), a library which allows rapid crafting and analysis of both attacks and defense methods for machine learning models. ART provides an implementation for many state-of-the-art methods for attacking and defending machine learning. At Black Hat, we will introduce the major version 1.0, which contains new powerful black-box attacks, support for additional machine learning libraries, as well as new defenses and detectors. Through ART, the attendees will (re)discover how to attack and defend diverse machine learning systems.

PKE (passive keyless entry) system allows the driver to unlock cars without taking out their key fob - just by being in the proximity of the vehicle or by touching the door handle. PKE systems use both low frequency and high frequency radio links to perform two-way authentication. We have implemented a relay attack using two very low-cost radios and have extended the range further than any previous research. We have already extended the attack range to a few hundred meters and can unlock your car in the parking lot while your key fob is in your pocket - on the top floor of your office building - or drive your car away while you are shopping in the mall.

As application, network, and product complexity grow, so do the attack surface and likelihood of vulnerabilities. Highly-skilled pen testers do not scale exponentially, and findings don't make it into secure coding practices or DevOps overnight.

How can we enable pen testers to focus on what matters: adversary-oriented penetration testing to detect the most difficult vulnerabilities and exploits? What correlations exist between successful exploits and underlying application or network characteristics? And how can we ensure findings actually make it back into the development lifecycle in a meaningful way?

Our research, and Python-based VAPT framework seeks to address these questions, and automates certain tasks to assist pen testers:

When it comes to the security of the information system, Active Directory domain controllers are, or should be, at the center of concerns, which are (normally) to ensure compliance with best practices, and during a compromise proved to explore the possibility of cleaning the information system without having to rebuild Active Directory. However, few tools implement this process and several ways exist to backdoor Active Directory. We propose to present some possible backdoors which could be set by an intruder in Active Directory to keep administration rights. For example, how to modify the AdminSDHolder container in order to reapply rights after administrator actions. Moreover, backdoors can be implemented in Active Directory to help an intruder to gain back his privileges. Then, we will present BTA, an audit tool for Active Directory databases, and our methodology for verifying the application of good practices and the absence of malicious changes in these databases.The presentation will be organized as follows:- We begin by describing the stakes around the Active Directory, centerpiece of any information system based on Microsoft technologies.- We will continue by demonstrating some backdoors in order to keep admins rights or to help an intruder to quickly recover admins rights.- We will present BTA and the methodology developed to analysis Active Directory.We conclude with a feedback on real world usage of BTA.More information can be found on the Bitbucket repository https: //bitbucket.org/iwseclabs/bta

![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
Adversarial attacks of machine learning systems have become an undisputable threat.

### [Adversarial Threat Detector](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
In recent years, deep learning technology has been developing, and various systems using deep learning are spreading in our society, such as face recognition, security cameras (anomaly detection), and ADAS (Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems).

On the other hand, there are many attacks that exploit vulnerabilities in deep learning algorithms. For example, the Evasion Attacks are an attack that causes the target classifier to misclassify the Adversarial Examples into the class intended by the adversary. The Exfiltration Attacks are an attack that steals the parameters and train data of a target classifier. If your system is vulnerable to these attacks, it can lead to serious incidents such as face recognition being breached, allowing unauthorized intrusion, or information leakage due to inference of train data.

So we released a vulnerability scanner called "Adversarial Threat Detector" (a.k.a. ATD), which automatically detects vulnerabilities in deep learning-based classifiers.

ATD contributes to the security of your classifier by executing the four cycles of "Detecting vulnerabilities (Scanning & Detection)", "Understanding vulnerabilities (Understanding)", "Fixing vulnerabilities (Fix)", and "Check fixed vulnerabilities (Re-Scanning)".

1. Detecting vulnerabilities（Scanning & Detection）
ATD automatically executes a variety of attacks against the classifier and detects vulnerabilities.

2. Understanding vulnerabilities (Understanding)
When a vulnerability is detected, ATD will generate a countermeasure report (HTML style) and a replay environment (ipynb style) of the vulnerabilities. Developers can understand the vulnerabilities by referring to the countermeasure report and the replay environment.

3. Fixing vulnerabilities (Fix)
ATD automatically fixes detected vulnerabilities.

4. Check fixed vulnerabilities (Re-Scanning)
The ATD checks fixed vulnerabilities of the fixed classifier.

Our "Adversarial Threat Detector" will contribute greatly to keep your safety.


### [AiCEF: An AI-powered Cyber Exercise Content Generation Framework](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
The core idea of AiCEF, is to harness the intelligence that is available from online and MISP reports, as well as threat groups' activities, arsenal etc., from, e.g., MITRE, to create relevant and timely cybersecurity exercises. To this end, we have developed a specialised ontology called Cyber Exercise Scenario Ontology (CESO), which extends STIX [2]. The core idea is to map reports; both from online resources and MISP, via a common ontology to graphs. This way, we abstract the events from the reports in a machine-readable form. The produced graphs can be infused with additional intelligence, e.g. the threat actor profile from MITRE, also mapped in our ontology. While this may fill gaps that would be missing from a report, one can also manipulate the graph to create custom and unique models. Finally, we exploit transformer-based language models like GPT to convert the graph into text that can serve as the scenario of a cybersecurity exercise.
We have tested and validated AiCEF with a group of experts in cybersecurity exercises, and the results clearly show that AiCEF significantly augments the capabilities in creating timely and relevant cybersecurity exercises in terms of both quality and time.


### [AKTAION](#)  
![BH-EU-16](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-EU-16-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
Crypto Ransomware has become a popular attack vector used by malicious actors to quickly turn infections into profits. From a defensive perspective, the detection of new ransomware variants relies heavily on signatures, point solution posture and binary level indicators of compromise (IOC). This approach is inefficient at protecting targets against the rapid changes in tactics and delivery mechanisms typical of modern ransomware campaigns. We propose a novel approach for blending multiple signals (called micro behaviors) to detect ransomware with more flexibility than using IOC matching alone.

The goal of the approach is to provide expressive mechanisms for detection via contextual indicators and micro behaviors that correlate to attacker tactics, even if they evolve with time. The presenters will provide open source code that will allow users and fellow researchers to replicate the use of these techniques. We will conclude with a focus on how to tie this approach to active defense measures and existing infrastructure.

This tool will be applied to PCAPS and will then mine and display relationships of Micro Behaviors particular to ransomware traffic. Built with Spark notebook https://github.com/andypetrella/spark-notebook we are leveraging Apache Spark (http://spark.apache.org/) for scalable data processing and MlLib for an analytics API (http://spark.apache.org/mllib/). The
notebook will provide an interface for the ingestion of heterogenous data and the ability to build a combination of behavior based risk indictors combined with classic signatures. Prototype examples of different risk profiles will be demonstrated with the API via spark notebook but the libraries themselves should be usable in any Java backed code base.

The AirTag IoT device is a tracking tool developed by Apple and designed to help people find misplaced objects. However, even when Apple states that AirTag technology is solely used for tracking items, a growing number of malicious individuals are taking advantage for the simplicity to install it and set up to track unaware targets, in other words, people.

Amini is a specialized open-source hardware project to scan, detect, spoof, and play a sound for AirTag devices. This project is part of "Spy-wear: Misuse of Apple AirTags" research where we analyzed a privacy concern about AirTag misuse for tracking capabilities. It was designed to be implemented with Arduino environment, for flexible designs, and to be used in any Arduino-supported devices with BLE capabilities.


### [An Extensible Dynamic Analysis Framework for IoT Devices](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
As IoT devices are more than ever present in our society, their security is becoming an increasingly important issue. Dynamic analysis has been proved the arsenal to many security applications (e.g., malware analysis, vulnerability discovery, backdoor analysis, etc.). While several dynamic analysis systems(Avatar, FEMU, Firmadyne, etc. ) have been proposed for IoT devices, they either rely on IoT hardware(Avatar), or lack user friendly interfaces for further extension. In this talk, we will present an extensible whole-system dynamic analysis framework for IoT devices. Specifically, on top of QEMU, we build a Pintool-like framework FirmPin, which provides Just-In-Time Virtual Machine Introspection and a plugin architecture with a simple-to-use event-driven programming interface. FirmPin provides the instrumentation at basic block level, system call level and memory access level for both user level and kernel level programs. Currently, FirmPin supports ARM and MIPS and can run customized kernel from Firmadyne project.

To demonstrate the power of FirmPin, we have created two plugins - MalScalpel and FirmFuzzer. MalScalpel is able to collect the instruction trace, system call trace, and unpacked code of the monitored program(e.g., Mirai). FirmFuzzer utilizes FirmPin to collect the execution information of fuzzed IoT applications, and integrates with AFL to conduct efficient fuzzing for IoT applications. In the future, we plan to add tainting, a powerful technique for many security applications, to the system. The ultimate goal of FirmPin is to be a general analysis framework for IoT devices.

### [An Open Stack for Threat Hunting in Hybrid Cloud With Connected Observability](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
We present a cloud-native threat hunting architecture built on open-source technologies. The security architecture integrates SysFlow and Kestrel to provide connected endpoint observability, edge analytics, and a cyber-reasoning stack that enables threat hunters to quickly and uniformly perform threat hunting and investigation across cloud and premise environments. This facilitates a new threat discovery methodology in which declarative hunting flows automate the search for behavioral attack patterns and indicators of compromise in telemetry data streams that are automatically tagged with attack TTPs. We show how these two open-source frameworks can deploy and scale natively on cloud environments to discover attacks and security breaches against cloud services and container infrastructures.

SysFlow is an open observability framework that lifts and normalizes the representation of system activities into a compact entity-relational format that records workload behaviors by connecting single-event and volumetric flow representations of process control flows, file interactions, and network communications. It drastically reduces data footprints over existing approaches and is particularly suitable for large scale cloud-wide monitoring and forensic investigation of sophisticated cyber-attacks that may not be discovered for long periods of time.

Kestrel is a threat hunting language for creating composable, reusable, and shareable hunt flows. It brings two key innovations to the security community: (i) a composable way of expressing hunting knowledge for threat hypothesis development and reasoning over entity-relational data abstractions, and (ii) an open-source language runtime to compute how to perform hunting steps and execute them in a distributed fashion at the local hunting site, remote data sources, and in the cloud.

We will demonstrate through live threat hunting scenarios how the two open-source projects can help create a powerful open platform for gaining operational awareness and alleviating key pain points in integrating security solutions into a "single-pane-of-glass" for effective and shareable threat hunting in the cloud.

![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
So far, there are many tools for vulnerability scanning, such as Mobsf, Yaazhini, 360 microscope, Tencent King Kong system. These tools have been able to cover a large part of the app vulnerability and many have supported dynamic and static vulnerability scanning, but there are a lot of false alert. The purpose of dynamic and static combination is also to improve the accuracy of vulnerability scanning, thereby reducing the rate of false alert, and also can make up for the shortcomings each other, so as to find out the vulnerabilities as much as possible, but the system is too large, the maintenance cost is high, and the scanning result is not ideally, it would be better that there is a simple and efficient tool.

SAST is a static android application vulnerability scanning tool. The architecture is simple and easy to use, and the maintenance cost is very low. Although it is a static scanning tool, the accuracy is very high. It is consists of androguard and vulnerability patterns. Because androguard is a powerful open source tool, it is highly customizable and provides excellent support in apk analysis. The vulnerability pattern mainly integrates the known and the latest app vulnerability features. Each pattern is independent of each other, no influence on each other, and strong scalability, so it is fast to update a new pattern and have a good performance. At the same time, it is used to scan various types of top500 applications in Google Play, and found out a lot of potential security issues for many applications, and we submitted some vulnerabilities to the vendors, which are currently being processed.

### [Androsia - A Step Ahead in Securing Sensitive In-Memory Android Application Data](#)  
![BH-ASIA-18](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ASIA-18-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
Each Android app runs in its own VM, with every VM allocated a limited heap size for creating new objects. Neither the app nor the OS differentiates between regular objects and objects that contain security sensitive information. The sensitive objects like any other object are kept around in the heap until the app hits a memory constraint. The OS then invokes the Dalvik garbage collector in order to reclaim memory from unreferenced objects on the heap and provides the reclaimed memory back to the app. However, there is no guarantee the objects containing security sensitive information will be cleared from memory. Even though objects might not be used ahead in the program, they might still be referenced directly or indirectly by a GC root which would prevent them from getting collected - a situation known as memory leak.Android does not provide explicit APIs to reclaim memory from sensitive objects which are not "used" ahead in the program. "java.security.*" library does provide classes for holding sensitive data (like KeyStore.PasswordProtection) and API's (like destroy()) to remove sensitive content from the objects. However, the onus of calling these APIs is on the developer. Developers may invoke these APIs at a stage very late in the code or worst may even forget to invoke them. This leaves a window of time where the security critical objects, which are not used any further in the program, live in the heap memory and wait to be garbage collected. During this window, a compromise of the app can allow an attacker to read the credentials by dumping the heap memory. This is a needless risk every Android application lives with today.We propose a tool called Androsia, which uses a summary based [1] inter-procedural data-flow analysis to determine the points in the program where security sensitive objects are last used (so that their content can be cleared). Androsia then performs bytecode transformation of the app to flush out the secrets resetting the objects to their default values.[1] D. Yan, G. Xu, and A. Rountev.

![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
Apk-medit is a memory search and patch tool for debuggable APK without root & android NDK. It was created for mobile game security testing.


Memory modification is the easiest way to cheat in games, it is one of the items to be checked in the security test. There are also cheat tools that can be used casually like GameGuardian. However, there were no tools available for non-root devices and CUI, so apk-medit was created as a security testing tool.


Many mobile games have rooting detection, but apk-medit does not require root privileges, so memory modification can be done without bypassing the rooting detection.

This should become a useful tool for the mobile penetration testers to validate the security issues report by a source code scanner and by inspecting the APIs in runtime and monitoring the app's overall activity and focus on things that seem suspicious. You can also use pre-defined user-scripts to modify the app's functionality/logic in the runtime e.g. spoofing the DeviceID, spoofing the GPS co-ordinates, faking In-App purchases, bypassing TouchID etc.In the current release, we have the ability to hook both the Apple's CoreFoundation API's as well as the Objective-C methods (even if its done in a Swift app via the bridging header).

### [Arsenal Theater Demo: Aktaion](#)  
![BH-US-16](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-US-16-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
Crypto Ransomware has become a popular attack vector used by malicious actors to quickly turn infections into profits. From a defensive perspective, the detection of new ransomware variants relies heavily on signatures, point solution posture and binary level indicators of compromise (IOC). This approach is inefficient at protecting targets against the rapid changes in tactics and delivery mechanisms typical of modern ransomware campaigns. We propose a novel approach for blending multiple signals (called micro behaviors) to detect ransomware with more flexibility than using IOC matching alone.The goal of the approach is to provide expressive mechanisms for detection via contextual indicators and micro behaviors that correlate to attacker tactics, even if they evolve with time. The presenters will provide open source code that will allow users and fellow researchers to replicate the use of these techniques. We will conclude with a focus on how to tie this approach to active defense measures and existing infrastructure.This tool will be applied to PCAPS and will then mine and display relationships of Micro Behaviors particular to ransomware traffic. Built with Spark notebook https://github.com/andypetrella/spark-notebook we are leveraging Apache Spark (https://spark.apache.org/) for scalable data processing and MlLib for an anlalytics API (https://spark.apache.org/mllib/). The notebook will provide an interface for the ingestion of heterogenous data and the ability to build a combination of behavior based risk indictors combined with classic signatures. Prototype examples of different risk profiles will be demonstrated with the API via spark notebook but the libraries themselves should be usable in any Java backed code base.

### [Arsenal Theater Demo: Faraday](#)  
![BH-US-16](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-US-16-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
Since collaborative pentesting is more common each day and teams become larger, sharing the information between pentesters can become a difficult task. Different tools, different formats, long outputs (in the case of having to audit a large network) can make it almost impossible. You may end up with wasted efforts, duplicated tasks, a lot of text files scrambled in your working directory. And then, you need to collect that same information from your teammates and write a report for your client, trying to be as clear as possible.The idea behind Faraday is to help you to share all the information that is generated during the pentest, without changing the way you work. You run a command, or import a report, and Faraday will normalize the results and share that with the rest of the team in real time. Faraday has more than 50 plugins available (and counting), including a lot of common tools. And if you use a tool for which Faraday doesn't have a plugin, you can create your own. During this presentation we're going release Faraday v2.0.0 with all the new features that we were working on for the last couple of months.


### [Arsenal Theater Demo: Highway to the Danger Drone](#)  
![BH-US-16](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-US-16-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
Do you feel the needâ¦ the need for speed? Then check out our brand new penetration testing drone. This Raspberry Pi based copter is both cheap and easy to create on your own, making it the first practical drone solution for your pentesting needs. Drones have emerged as the prevailing weapon of choice in modern warfare, so it's only logical that we'd also explore the potential applications of this formidable tool in cyber warfare. While there have been presentations before on weaponizing drones for the purposes of pentesting, these efforts were not easily replicated by anyone other than experienced drone aficionados with several thousands of dollars to spend â ultimately resulting in somewhat clunky, partial solutions. Conditions have finally matured enough to where pentesters who are inexperienced with drones can get up and running fairly quickly and spending only a couple hundred dollars on a Raspberry Pi based drone copter solution. Our talk will be aimed at this target audience, helping equip pentesters with drone tools of the future.In this talk, we'll demonstrate how this drone can be used to perform aerial recon, attack wireless infrastructure and clients, land on a target facility roof, and serve as a persistent backdoor. In fact, we'll show you how to attack 'over the air' protocols such as RFID, ZigBee, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and more. We'll even demo a special edition "RickMote Danger Drone" that you can use to patrol your neighborhood and rickroll Google Chromecast-connected TVs.Additionally, we will showcase the best-of-breed in hardware and software that you'll need. This will include the release of our custom Raspberry Pi SD card image, parts list, 3D print objects, and necessary instructions for you to create a Danger Drone of your own. We'll also be giving away a fully functional Danger Drone to one lucky audience member - guaranteed to leave your friends feeling peanut butter and jealous! This DEMO-rich presentation will benefit both newcomers and seasoned professionals of drone and physical penetration testing fields. Someone better call Kenny Loggins, because you're in the Danger Drone.â¦No, no boys, there's two 'O's in Bishop Fox.

### [Arsenal Theater Demo: WarBerryPi Troops Deployment in Red Teaming Scenarios](#)  
![BH-US-16](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-US-16-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
What if the only requirements for taking down a corporate network are a bit of smooth talking, 60 minutes and $35? Traditional hacking techniques and corporate espionage have evolved. Advanced attacks nowadays include a combination of social engineering, physical security penetration and logical security hacking. It is our job as security professionals to think outside the box and think about the different ways that hackers might use to infiltrate corporate networks. The WarBerryPi is a customized RaspBerryPi hacking dropbox which is used in Red Teaming engagements with the sole purpose of performing reconnaissance and mapping of an internal network and providing access to the remote hacking team.The outcome of these red teaming exercises is the demonstration that if a low cost microcomputer loaded with python code can bypass security access controls and enumerate and gather such a significant amount of information about the infrastructure network which is located at; then what dedicated hackers with a large capital can do is beyond conception.

### [Attack Demonstration Tool Kits for Industry 4.0 Using AI and Cloud](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
Industry 4.0 is a new concept of automation data exchange in manufacturing, and technologies and structures are significantly different from the current general ICS. Autonomous judgment and execution are required, and it is based on information exchange using AI and cloud technologies. Devices are supposed to connect interactively that can create new attack surfaces and risks of cyber-attacks.

For instance, if AI on the cloud is used for controlling the ICS, attackers could change parameters for controlling ICS by contaminating the judgment of AI. In such a situation, attackers could compromise ICS without accessing the ICS network. Detecting such attacks is quite challenging if operators rely on AI to judge the desirable parameters of ICS. Therefore, it is important to instruct cyber risks of ICS in Industry 4.0.

We introduce attack demonstration took kits for Industry 4.0 using actual machines (water supply pump system).

This tool kit is portable, and easy to prepare, so is useful for instructing the cyber-risks of ICS whenever and whenever we want. In aspects of Industry 4.0, we especially focus on the security risks of ICS in the following aspects:
- When computers and devices are connected interactively
- When AI on the cloud is used for controlling the ICS

We will show you a demonstration of attacks: the attacker can change the physical status of ICS without accessing the ICS network through an attack against AI.


### [Attack Knowledge Base for Automotive](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
Ensuring cybersecurity in the automotive sector is more crucial than ever, especially with the rising intricacies and susceptibilities of vehicle-connected systems. The ISO/SAE 21434 standard serves as a beacon in this endeavor. However, compliance with this standard reveals discernible information disparities across its V-model phases: Concept & Design, Implementation, and Verification & Validation. Addressing these gaps is paramount for cohesive vehicle cybersecurity.

To tackle these hurdles, we introduce the "Attack Knowledge Base for Automotive." Inspired and aligned with the ATT&CK framework, this tool aids in seamless compliance with the ISO/SAE 21434 standard. We will demonstrate its efficacy in delivering a thorough and objective outcome during Threat Analysis and Risk Assessment (TARA). Moreover, it bridges information lacunas across the lifecycle, enabling the red team to synergize insights from earlier stages with our Attack Knowledge Base, ensuring holistic automotive cybersecurity.


### [AutoGadgetFS: USB testing made easy](#)

### [AutoMacTC: Finding Worms in Apple Orchards - Using AutoMacTC for macOS Incident Response](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
The recent rise of macOS in enterprise environments has not gone unnoticed by adversaries, who often take advantage of unmanaged and unsupervised Mac assets for their misdeeds.

A traditional forensic approach can no longer support enterprise investigations – they require rapid triage and response, often due to resource constraints and a pressing need for answers and remediation. Performing forensic imaging and deep-dive analysis can be incredibly time-consuming and induce data fatigue in analysts, who may only need a select number of artifacts to identify leads and start finding answers. The resources-to-payoff ratio is impractical.

In this presentation, we will discuss AutoMacTC: an open-source Python framework that can be quickly deployed to gather forensic data on macOS devices, from the artifacts that matter most to you and your investigation. Incident response in the macOS world requires that analysts know where to look for evil, gather the relevant data quickly, and know how to discern the malicious from the innocuous. AutoMacTC captures sufficient data into a singular location, equipping responders with all of the above.


### [AutoSuite: An Open-Source Multi-Protocol Low-Cost Vehicle Bus Testing Framework](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
Vehicle buses such as FlexRay, LIN, CAN (FD) and Ethernet are the cornerstones of ECUs communication. At present, the security research of vehicle buses mainly focuses on CAN Bus. Due to the characteristics of the protocol itself, CAN data is usually transmitted within the domain. while Flexray is often used as a backbone network connecting powertrain control, autonomous driving, and body control domains for cross-domain communication and transmission of critical data.
It is commonly used in high-end brands such as Audi, Lotus, and BMW. However, security research on Flexray is still in its infancy.

We will present AutoSuite, an open-source, multi-protocol, low-cost vehicle bus testing framework, consisting of the AutoBox(hardware) and AutoFunc (software). AutoSuite can be used to access the FlexRay bus and simulate malicious ECUs to send forged data to realize cross-domain ECU attacks and discover potential security vulnerabilities.

AutoBox is probably the first open-source, multi-protocol, low-cost vehicle bus testing hardware that support FlexRay. It can automatically analyze FlexRay bus configuration parameters, join the cluster, and send malicious data on the FlexRay bus. The hardware cost is about $200, which is much lower than the commercial FlexRay bus testing tool Vector VN8910 ($50k). AutoBox also supports remote control, multiple device collaboration, and Ethernet, LIN, and CAN (FD) protocols. AutoBox will provide a friendly, open-source, and low-cost testing tool for vehicle bus researchers, much like HACKRF has become a low-cost alternative to USRP.

AutoFunc may be the first open-source software for functional-level communication testing and functional-level fuzzing that supports condition monitoring. Current open-source vehicle bus testing methods mainly rely on random fuzzing of the CAN protocol by using random data frame IDs, payloads, and DLC. However, a vehicle function typically involves multiple data frames, and a single data frame may not have any impact on the bus. With opendbc and other open-source projects, the .dbc file is no longer a commercial secret. AutoFunc can organize the frames defined in the .dbc file into specific functions, and monitor the function where the crash occurs to achieve a multi-protocol fuzzing test.

In addition, we will show 2 demos,
(1) Demonstrate all functions supported by AutoBox, such as FlexRay, CAN, LIN, Ethernet, WiFi, etc.
(2) Functional-level fuzzing using AutoBox and AutoFunc.

### [Automatic API Attack Tool](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
Imperva's customizable API attack tool takes an API specification as an input, creates and runs attacks which are based on it as an output.

After researching the web, we didn't find an automatic tool which takes an API specification and checks the server offering the service against it. But we saw a high demand for such a tool from the community. So we decided to build it.

The tool is able to parse the API specification and create fuzzing attack scenarios based on what it defines, and outside of its definition. Each endpoint is injected with cleverly generated values within the boundaries defined by the specification, and outside of it, the appropriate requests are sent and their success or failure are reported in a detailed manner. It is also able to run various security attack vectors targeted at the existing endpoints, or even non-existing ones (such as illegal resource access, XSS, SQLi and RFI).
No human intervention needed, simply run the tool and get the results.

The tool can be easily extended to adapt to the various needs; whether it is a developer who wants to test the API she wrote or an organization which wants to run regular vulnerability or positive security scans on its public API, you name it. It is built with CI/CD in mind.

We are using this tool, among other tools, to check our security products internally.

### [BADINTENT - INTEGRATING ANDROID WITH BURP](#)  
![BH-EU-17](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-EU-17-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
BadIntent is the missing link between the Burp Suite and the core Android's IPC/Messaging-system. BadIntent consists of two parts, an Xposed-based module running on Android and a Burp-plugin. Based on this interplay, it is possible to use the Burp's common workflow and all involved tools and extensions, since the intercept and repeater functionality is provided. BadIntent hooks deeply into the Android system, performs various method redirections in Parcels and adds additional services to provide the described features. Most notably, BadIntent works system-wide and is not restricted to individual user apps.

In the demo, we will present various attacks against target apps, such as attacking encrypted containers, mobile XSS, SQLi, malicious GCM/FCM-payloads and more. Furthermore, we will show how to bypass obfuscation techniques by exploiting the app as a black box and implicitly attack backends. Finally, the brand-new passive and active scanning integration will be presented.

![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
The new, free tool aims to help getting familiar with the very basics of ubiquitous Bluetooth Low Energy technology and its (in)security - without the need of any dedicated hardware. It is based on a specially designed software (running on a typical Windows 10 laptop) - which simulates a BLE device, on the radio layer working exactly the same as a real one. The simulated device contains several "hackme" challenges of increasing level: starting with simple communication protocol introduction up to unlocking smart locks. Most of these challenges can be solved using nothing more than just a free mobile application, which connects via Bluetooth to the laptop running simulated device. This unique approach makes the fun available for everyone who would like to start the journey into fascinating vulnerabilities of BLE devices, but is afraid of gearing up with special hardware or steep learning curve for advanced tools. The basics possible to grasp using the introduced hackme can however be easily applicable to take control of surprisingly lot of real devices surrounding us.

![BH-ASIA-16](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ASIA-16-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
When it comes to the security of the information system, Active Directory domain controllers are, or should be, at the center of concerns, which are (normally) to ensure compliance with best practices, and during a compromise proved to explore the possibility of cleaning the information system without having to rebuild Active Directory. Indeed, backdoors can be implemented in Active Directory to help an intruder to gain back his privileges. However, few tools implement this cleaning/survey process despite several ways existing for backdooring Active Directory.We propose to present some possible backdoors which could be set by an intruder in Active Directory to keep administration rights. For example, how to modify the AdminSDHolder container in order to reapply rights after administrator actions. Then, we will present BTA, an audit tool for Active Directory databases, and our methodology for verifying the application of good practices and the absence of malicious changes in these databases. One of example, that we will show, is how to spot accounts which have DCSync rights and pulls account credentials through the standard Domain Controller replication API.The presentation will be organized as follows:We begin by describing the stakes around the Active Directory, centerpiece of any information system based on Microsoft technologies.We will continue by demonstrating some backdoors in order to keep admins rights or to help an intruder to quickly recover admins rights.We will present BTA and the methodology developed to analysis Active Directory.We conclude with a feedback on real world usage of BTA.More information can be found on the Bitbucket repository: https: //bitbucket.org/iwseclabs/bta

### [Beagle: Accelerating Incident Response With Graphs](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
Beagle is a tool which aims to accelerate an analyst's ability to respond to incidents by allowing them to quickly and reliably generate incident response oriented graphs from a variety of data sources.

Beagle takes, as input, a wide variety of types of data:

Host based logs such as FireEye HX, Sysmon or security event logs.
Full memory images (using volatility).
Sandbox reports such as Cuckoo.
Streamed data from your SIEM.

Beagle also supports inserting alert nodes into your graphs. For example, FireEye HX triages will contain an alert, and the process which it has alerted on. Beagle will automatically insert an alert node, and create the edge between the alert node and what it alerted on.

In Beagle's web interface, analysts can select the data they uploaded and quickly work through the incident. If an alert node is present, the graph will automatically focus on the context around that node based on what the alert node has an edge to, allowing analysts to extremely quickly pivot through an incident. Analysts can pivot between nodes using simple clicks, as well as remove and search for nodes. Additionally, the graphs can be transformed into rooted trees, or seen as timelines (based on what is currently visible in the graph).

Beagle is also easily extended. Do you have a unique data source not yet supported? Implement 7 functions and Beagle will support it. Graph algorithms can also be implemented using networkx, and can be automatically run when a graph is viewed in the browser, allowing you to even further speed up your incident response time.

![BH-US-13](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-US-13-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
Binfuzz.js is a library for fuzzing structured binary data in JavaScript. Structured binary data is data that can be easily represented by one or more C structures: it is composed of fixed size fields and any variable length fields are counted by another structure member. Numerous network and file formats are structured binary data, including SSL, DNS, and most image formats. Things that aren't structured binary data include languages (such as HTML or JavaScript) or text-based protocols (such as HTTP) or text-based file formats (such as PDF). A live example will be shown using Binfuzz.js to generate Windows ICO files to stress a browser's icon parsing and display code. ICO is a complex format that contains images of different sizes for optimal display based on context. Binfuzz.js will try generating edge cases such as an icon with 0xFFFF images of size 0xFFFFFFFF by 0xFFFFFFF, and cases such as saying that there are 128 images but only supplying data for one, among many other permutations. It is the author's hope that others will extend binfuzz.js for other use cases.


### [BLOODHOUND](#)  
![BH-EU-16](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-EU-16-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
Active Directory domain privilege escalation is a critical component of most penetration tests and red team assessments, but standard methodology dictates a manual and often tedious process - gather credentials, analyze new systems we now have admin rights on, pivot, and repeat until we reach our objective. Then - and only then - we can look back and see the path we took in its entirety. But that may not be the only, nor shortest path we could have taken.

By combining the concept of derivative admin (the chaining or linking of administrative rights), existing tools, and graph theory, we have developed a capability called BloodHound, which can reveal the hidden and unintended relationships in Active Directory domains. BloodHound is operationally-focused, providing an easy-to-use web interface and PowerShell ingestor for memory-resident data collection and offline analysis.

BloodHound offers several advantages to both attackers and defenders. Otherwise invisible, high-level organizational relationships are exposed. Most possible escalation paths can be efficiently and swiftly identified. Simplified data aggregation accelerates blue and red team analysis. BloodHound has the power and the potential to dramatically change the way you think about and approach Active Directory domain security.

At Black Hat Europe 2016, we will unveil the newest addition to BloodHound: object ACL control relationships. We will also unveil new defensive analytics and automated analysis possible only with BloodHound.

![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
Every Android phone loves Bluetooth, a short-range wireless communication technology. We can find a large number of Bluetooth devices in any public place. Many of their security issues have been exposed before, such as BlueBorne, KNOB, and BadBluetooth. Today, due to the security risks in AOSP (Android Open Source Project) and the negligence of some well-known mobile phone manufacturers, we designed a new attack idea and dug a new 0day BlueRepli (Bluetooth Replicant). At the same time, we have implemented the relevant utility tool on the customized universal hardware platform and called it BlueRepli Plus.

With BlueRepli Plus users can scan the surrounding Android phones via Bluetooth and attack any Android phones found. If the target Android phone has a BlueRepli vulnerability, the user can obtain the phone's address book, SMS message, or send a fake text message without the target feeling; if the target Android phone is not affected by the BlueRepli vulnerability, the tool allows the user to disguise as a well-known Application name or other very confusing names, to deceive the target, obtain permissions, and finally achieve the same attack effect.

The little browser hacking framework that could; BeEF (Once again voted in the top 5 security tools on ToolsWatch.org) is back again for another hands on JavaScript-filled arsenal session of insanity. If you've seen people talk about BeEF, and haven't gotten around to getting your hands dirty, then now is the perfect time to look under the cover and see how hook.js works. While the framework itself is hanging together with duct tape, Ruby and JavaScript, the capabilities of BeEF have been slowly marching forward year by year, with new features being added almost as quickly as new HTML5 APIs are added to browsers. Two of the larger additions to the framework have been the Autorun Rules Engine (ARE) and the Network Extension, the brain-children of @antisnatchor and @_bcoles. But BeEF isn't just about client-side testing, it's also a great tool if you need to quickly PoC JavaScript-based payloads.This session will cover the following:Hands on with the Autorun Rules Engine (clever scheduling and automation of multiple payloads)Network Extension (just how much local network can a browser see?)Having fun with CSRFSo you think HttpOnly & Secure flags really help?Attendees will hopefully have a better appreciation of how BeEF works, and how custom modules and extensions can be developed to meet any custom requirements you may have.


### [BucketLoot - An Automated S3 Bucket Inspector](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
Thousands of S3 buckets are left exposed over the internet, making it a prime target for malicious actors who may extract sensitive information from the files in these buckets that can be associated with an individual or an organisation. There is a limited research or tooling available that leverages such S3 buckets for looking up secret exposures and searching specific keywords or regular expression patterns within textual files.
BucketLoot is an automated S3 Bucket Inspector that can simultaneously scan all the textual files present within an exposed S3 bucket from platforms such as AWS, DigitalOcean etc. It scans the exposed textual files for:
- Secret Exposures
- Assets (URLs, Domains, Subdomains)
- Specific keywords | Regex Patterns (provided by the user)
The end user can even search for string based keywords or provide custom regular expression patterns that can be matched with the contents of these exposed textual files. All of this makes BucketLoot a great recon tool for bug hunters as well as professional pentesters.
The tool allows users to save the output in a JSON format which makes it easier to pass the results as an input to some third-party product or platform.

![BH-US-16](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-US-16-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
The Burp Non-HTTP proxy is specifically designed to help in testing thick client and mobile applications. It adds to BurpSuite a DNS server to help test applications that are difficult to route through proxies and adds interceptors to manipulate/mangle binary and non-HTTP protocols.The tool stores traffic in a sqlite database that can be exported or imported to save and analyze later. It can intercept and modify traffic automatically based on rules you assign or it can be modified manually as the traffic hits the proxy server. The tool also support SSL/TLS and signs certificates based on Burps CA certificate. If your testing on a mobile device that already has Burp's CA cert then the traffic will be seamlessly decrypted without errors into the tool for you to mangle before sending it on to the outgoing server.This tool arouse out of the need to test applications that were switching to more realtime protocols in both mobile applications and some web based Silverlight applications I had been testing. I wrote this tool as an easy extension to add to burp that would also be platform/OS independent vs some other tools out there that did similar functions.

Burp-hash is a Burp Suite plugin. Many applications will hash parameters, such as ID numbers and email addresses for use in secure tokens, like session cookies. The plugin will passively scan requests looking for hashed values. Once a hashed value is found, it is compared to a table of parameters already observed in the application to find a match. The plugin keeps a lookout for parameters, such as usernames, email addresses, and ID numbers. It also keeps a lookout for hashes (SHA, MD5, etc). It hashes new data and compares to observed hashes. The user receives a notification if any hashes match. This automates the process of trying to guess common parameters used in the generation of hashes observed in an application.

### [CLExtract: An End-to-End Tool Decoding Highly Corrupted Satellite Stream from Eavesdropping](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
While satellite communication with ground stations can be eavesdropped on using consumer-grade products, the received signals are oftentimes highly corrupted and cannot be effectively decoded using the traditional finite-state machine (FSM) based approach.

To this end, we develop a tool named CLExtract which utilizes contrastive learning techniques to decode and recover corrupted satellite streams. Unlike the traditional FSM-based approach which relies on critical fields that become unreliable after corruption, CLExtract directly learns the features of packet headers at different layers and identifies them in a stream sequence. By filtering out these headers, CLExtract extracts the innermost payload which contains sensitive and private data. Further, CLExtract incorporates data augmentation techniques to entitle the trained contrastive learning models with robustness against unseen forms of corruption.

To evaluate CLExtract, we performed eavesdropping on the spectrum range from 11 GHZ to 12.75 GHZ in a suburban area of a metropolis with more than 10 million of population in Asia, covering radio signals from seven commercial satellites. CLExtract can successfully decode and recover 71-99% of the total 23.6GB eavesdropped data, a significant improvement over the traditional FSM-based approach implemented by GSExtract which only recovers 2%.

During the arsenal presentation, we will make CLExtract open source and demonstrate its usage to the security community using real-world satellite streams. This way, we hope to foster future research on satellite offense and defense techniques.

![BH-EU-17](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-EU-17-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
Nowadays, cloud infrastructure is pretty much the de-facto service used by large/small companies. Most of the major organizations have entirely moved to cloud. With more and more companies moving to cloud, the security of cloud becomes a major concern.

While AWS provides you protection with traditional security methodologies and has a neat structure for authorization/configuration, its security is as robust as the person in charge of creating/assigning these configuration policies. As we all know, human error is inevitable and any such human mistake could lead to catastrophic damage to the environment.

### [CROZONO FRAMEWORK: LEVERAGING AUTONOMOUS DEVICES AS AN ATTACK VECTOR ON INDUSTRIAL NETWORKS](#)  
![BH-EU-16](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-EU-16-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
CROZONO is a framework that allows performing automated penetration tests from autonomous devices (drones, robots, etc.) that could ease the access to the logical infrastructure of an industrial facility, evading physical barriers. The CROZONO framework is presented in two versions: "CROZONO Explorer" and "CROZONO Attacker."

At first, it is advisable to use CROZONO Explorer, as it allows the user to perform information gathering about possible attack vectors on the whole industrial facility's perimeter or any other sector. The information gathered by CROZONO Explorer allows the user to see the location of WiFi Access Points and IP Cameras, together with their security levels. The purpose of this step is to find the easiest way to compromise the industrial facility's security. For example, attacking those WiFi access points which have the lowest security level, if any security measures at all.

CROZONO Attacker is a smart framework, it has the capability of performing automated attacks targeted to a network, and to take decisions -without the need of the attacker's intervention- on which attacks to perform based on pre-established parameters and the information gathered about its target. The goal of CROZONO Attacker is to breach the network attacking a WiFi access point and then opening a reverse connection to the attacker via the victim's internet connection. Once performed, CROZONO Attacker allows - through its "LAN discovery" and "LAN Attacks" modules - to discover other devices in the target network and launch several attacks on it.

One of the best exclusive features of CROZONO is the report generation about all information gathered. In few minutes, it is possible to explore a zone or an industrial facility's perimeter and know its weak points from the summarization of data captured visually, allowing to see its security exposure levels.


### [CSF: Container Security Framework](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
There are billions of containers started by organizations on a daily basis. Thus, there has been a considerable need to invest in container security along with the security for conventional compute instance (like a physical machine, AWS EC2, etc.). Currently, there is no open-source automated solution that enables the organization to constantly monitor security hygiene of their container ecosystem.

ArmourBird CSF - Container Security Framework is an extensible, modular, API-first framework build for regular security monitoring of docker installations and containers against CIS and other custom security checks.

ArmourBird CSF has a client-server architecture and is thus divided into two components:

a) CSF Client

This component is responsible for monitoring the docker installations, containers, and images on target machines
In the initial release, it will be checking against Docker CIS benchmark
The checks in the CSF client will be configurable and thus will be expanded in future releases and updates
It has been build on top of Docker bench for security

b) CSF Server

This will be the receiver agent for the security logs generated by the various distributed CSF clients (installed on multiple physical/virtual machines)
This will also have a UI sub-component for unified management and dashboard-ing of the various vulnerabilities/issues logged by the CSF Clients
This server will also expose APIs that can be used for integrating with other systems

![BH-US-15](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-US-15-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
There are a lot of tools written for security research and CTFs, but fairly few gain enough traction to be packaged and distributed by the likes of Ubuntu, or even Kali. Worse, when they *are* packaged, the packaged versions are often hopelessly outdated. This is unfortunate, and causes most researchers to have to spend time tracking down, compiling, configuring, and installing these tools. Also, when a computer has to be reinstalled the process generally has to be done again.There is a need for a central repository of such tools to track them and allow security researchers to easily install them (without screwing up the whole host system!). This is the story of such a repository.I've gone through the list of tools I've used in CTFs and in my research I have found the ones that are not adequately packaged, and created a central place for install scripts. The build system works with simple shell scripts (for easier contribution of packages) and installs everything under ~/tools (or, really, any other directory), without any global system changes (except for apt-getting dependencies from official repositories).As far as I can tell, this is the first repository of obscure security research tools, and I think it'll be a useful thing for the community at large.


### [CWE_Checker: Architecture-Independent Binary Vulnerability Analysis](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
Assessing the security of programs running on embedded devices is a difficult task. Source code is generally unavailable and both static and dynamic binary analysis tools often do not offer support for the many different hardware configurations found in embedded devices.

The cwe_checker is an open-source tool for finding bugs and vulnerabilities in binary executables without requiring source code access or any knowledge about the hardware. By using static analysis techniques built atop Ghidra P-Code it supports a wide range of CPU architectures including x86, ARM, MIPS and PowerPC. While its focus is the analysis of ELF binaries commonly found in Linux-based firmware, there exists experimental support for PE files and even bare-metal binaries.

The cwe_checker offers detection of over 16 different bug classes including Buffer Overflows (CWE-119), Use-After-Frees (CWE-416) and Null Dereferences (CWE-476). The tool is built in a modular fashion where each analysis can use its own bug detection technique ranging from simple heuristics to complex data flow analysis. Furthermore, each analysis has a set of configuration parameters that can be modified to adjust the analysis to specific usage scenarios. For example, you can add your own functions to the "Use of potentially dangerous function" check (CWE-676).

It is easy to integrate the cwe_checker into other tools and workflows using the alternative JSON output. For example, as a plugin into the Firmware Analysis and Comparison Tool (FACT) you can use it to hunt for vulnerabilities in large firmware data sets.

![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
Threat intelligence chat bots are useful friends. They perform research for you and can even be note takers or central aggregators of information. However, it seems like most organizations want to design their own bot in isolation and keep it internal. To counter this trend, our goal was to create a repeatable process using an completely free and open source framework, an inexpensive Raspberry Pi (or even virtual machine), and host a community-driven plugin framework to open up the world of threat intel chat bots to everyone from the home user to the largest security operations center.

We are excited to demo the end result of our research at Black Hat Arsenal - a chat bot that we affectionately call CyBot. We will show you what CyBot can do for you and graciously accept feedback on future improvements. Best of all, if you know even a little bit of Python, you can help write plugins and share them with the community. If you want to build your own CyBot, the instructions in this project will let you do so with about an hour of invested time and anywhere from $0-$35 in expenses. Come make your own threat intelligence bot today!

### [Capture the Signal: Running Wireless IoT CTFs, Remotely!](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
The famous DEFCON CTF is one of the thousands Capture the Flag (CTFs) contests that, since many years, have become the "lifeblood" of the cybersecurity community. CTF players reverse-engineer vulnerable services in traditional IT applications (like web and binary) to score points.

Given the increased adoption of wireless-connected devices and pervasive, interconnected networks of so-called "IoT systems," since 2018 our teams of researchers have been promoting an RF-specific version of traditional CTFs, in which contestants are asked to reverse engineer radio-based protocols as opposed to traditional network communications. We called our contest the Capture the Signal (CTS) (https://www.trendmicro.com/cts/). This activity is also known as "blind signal analysis" as the signals' specification are unknown to the attacker. Each radio signal corresponds to a challenge. The challenges are organized by difficulty levels, and each solved challenge unlocks the next one. In other words, the flag concealed in each signal represents the clue to the next radio signal (e.g., the tuning frequency or any other radio parameters). The more points are scored, the closer the contestant is to win.

In normal circumstances, we've hosted the game on site at conferences world-wide, where radio signals are distributed "over the air", and participant are asked to use software-defined radio equipment to interact with the challenges. However, due the diverse local regulations in terms of wireless transmissions, we designed and implemented a containerized solution that eliminates the complexity of deploying physical radio transmitters, using an RF-over-IP broadcasting technique instead. With this framework, we can easily deploy CTS contests in countries with strict wireless regulation and remotely, backed by any cloud provider that offer container services.

![BH-ASIA-17](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ASIA-17-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
CellAnalysis is a tool every pentester should add to his/her arsenal. Nowadays there are other tools intended to find fake cells (fake stations, IMSI Catchers, etc.), most of them use active monitoring; that is, they monitor traffic coming to the SIM card on a smartphone, so that only cell attacks are scanned on the same network as the SIM card. CellAnalysis offers a different approach, it performs a passive traffic monitoring, so it doesn't require a SIM card or a mobile device, just an OsmocomBB phone or compatible device SDR (rtlsdr, usrp, hackrf or bladerf) to start monitoring all the frequencies of the GSM spectrum.Far from being an out-of-the-box tool, it has been developed using shell-scripting to make easier the code modification or the customization by the pentester, as well as the integration with other tools. SDR device or OsmocomBB phone connected to the computer running Linux will analyze the spectrum or a part of it, in search of cells and for each cell found, a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the information transmitted will be carried out. Alarms generation is not based on a scoring system, but each parameter chosen as a potential threat will generate an alarm if it is evaluated as such in the cell under study.

![BH-US-16](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-US-16-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
The majority of the world's Web traffic is still unencrypted and sent using the insecure HTTP. Despite SSL/TLS having existed for decades, it has seen limited adoption on modern webservers. This is largely due to the plethora of obstacles one must over come to enable HTTPS. The process of obtaining a certificate can be expensive and convoluted. Additionally, creating a secure TLS configuration is difficult, especially when it must be constantly updated in response to new attacks against the protocol and implementations of it.To attempt to solve this problem, EFF, Mozilla Cisco, Akamai, IdenTrust, and a team from the University of Michigan have created Let's Encrypt, a free and automated certificate authority. Since the project entered beta in October of last year, the CA has issued millions of certificates making it one of the largest certificate authorities in the world today.Earlier this year, EFF unveiled Certbot, a free and open source tool which can be used to set up HTTPS on a webserver in the matter of seconds. Certbot communicates to the Let's Encrypt CA through a protocol called ACME allowing for automated domain validation and certificate issuance. In this session, I plan to show how easy it is to use Certbot to enable HTTPS with certificates from Let's Encrypt as well as answer any questions you may have about the project.


### [ChangWei: A Modern Fuzzing Framework for VxWorks System](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
VxWorks is the industry's leading real-time operating system. It has been widely used in various industry scenarios, which require real-time, deterministic performance and, in many cases, safety and security certification. Since VxWorks has so much importance in industry, more and more people are working on security problems around it.

Fuzzing is an effective technique to discovery vulnerabilities. Feedback-guided fuzzing, such as AFL(American Fuzzy Lop), has proven its excellent ability in finding vulnerabilities of complex programs. Fuzzing tools using this technique have been widely applied to Linux, MacOS and even Windows, but never to VxWorks. According to the current situation, we design a feedback-guided fuzzing tool named "ChangWei" especially for VxWorks. We take advantage of the instrumentation API of Bochs emulator to measure and extract target coverage in a persistent fuzzing mode, and then generate input samples with the help of AFL mutation engine.

We are going to utilize this tool to assist developers to test their code and find hidden vulnerabilities before they are discovered by malicious attackers. Apart from that, we'd like anyone who has interest in this to help us optimize it and build a powerful tool for the security industry.

As we all know, human error is inevitable and any such human mistake could lead to catastrophic damage to the environment.A few vulnerable scenarios:Your security groups, password policy or IAM policies are not configured properlyS3 buckets are world-readableWeb servers supporting vulnerable ssl ciphersPorts exposed to public with vulnerable services running on themIf root credentials are usedLogging or MFA is disabledAnd many more such scenarios...Knowing all this, audit of AWS/GCP infrastructure becomes a hectic task! There are few open source tools that help AWS/GCP auditing, but none of them have an exhaustive checklist. Also, collecting, setting up all the tools, and looking at different result sets is a painful task. Moreover, while maintaining big infrastructures, system audit of server instances is a major task as well.CS Suite is a one stop tool for auditing the security posture of the AWS/GCP infrastructure and does OS audits as well. CS Suite leverages current open-source tools capabilities and has other missing checks added into one tool to rule them all. CS-Suite also supports JSON output which can be consumed for further usage.

Next generation threats are becoming more sophisticated and stealthy, and incident response teams require more advanced tools to respond to such attacks. CodexGigas is a malware profiling search engine that allows malware hunters and analysts to really interrogate the internals of malware and perform searches over a large number of file characteristics. For instance, instead of relying on file-level hashes, we can compute other features such as imported functions, strings, constants, file segments, code regions, or anything that is defined in the file type specification, and that provides us with more than 150 possible searchable patterns, that can be combined. Similar to human fingerprints, every malware has its own unique digital fingerprint that differentiates it from others. As a result, malware will always attempt to hide its true self by deleting or changing this information to avoid detection by antivirus companies and malware researchers.

Since malware developers go to great lengths to obfuscate their characteristics, it is often difficult for by researchers and malware analysts to identify multiple characteristics and correlation points. By analyzing malware internals, the algorithm is able to build characteristic families to which a new sample can be categorized and therefore identified for specific behavior, enabling early detection of new malware by comparing against existing malware.

Come to see how CodexGigas could be used to enhance your malware hunting capabilities.

### [Cylon-6: An EDID Fuzzer Based on Raspberry Pi Hardware](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
EDID stands for "Extended Display Identification Data", is a data format for monitors to describe thier capabilities, such as screen size or resolutions. EDID is transmitted to graphics card through DDC, a data channel based on I2C bus, which directly bridges the graphics card and EEPROM inside display devices.

The EDID data (128 or 256 Bytes) is stored in EEPROM. So, there is an attack scenario by messing with EDID data. Andy Davis already made a speech at BlackHat EU 2012 to show his research on fuzzing EDID and CEC, and he did find some vulnerabilities or problems. However, Raspberry Pi (RPi) was not widely used at the time when Andy chose Arduino to do the job. So, we build an EDID fuzzer based on RPi, making it rather easy to perform EDID fuzzing.

We make RPi to work as an I2C slave device with the help of GPIO, and simulate EEPROM operations to act like a real EEPROM device. Thus we can return any data back to operating system when VGA or HDMI cable is plugged in. Besides, this tool is also able to attach and detach the "display" automatically, by setting high or low voltage on the "hotplug" pin inside VGA and HDMI interfaces.

In general, this tool is will assist security researchers to perform EDID fuzzing against any kinds of graphics drivers, without knowing about I2C protocol or EEPROM. All we need is a RPi (2 or later) , and use some dupont lines to connect the RPi to VGA/HDMI interfaces. The code and documents will be available on Github as soon as been fully tested. And we will appreciate it if anyone interested in this project helps to improve it and make it a powerful tool for IoT security filed.

### [Cylons: An automated IoT security assessment platform based on OpenWRT](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
Smart/IoT devices these days are all about network, Internet in particular. When a box gets itself connected to the cloud, it exposes lots of attack surface as well. Hence, network assessment plays a fundamental role in IoT SDL (Security Development Lifecycle) practices. We have built a platform which aims to help security engineers to automate some common assessment workloads, black-box testing specifically.

With the help of OpenWRT, we are freed from wired/wireless network setup work, thus focusing more on traffic monitoring and parsing. Once a device got connected, Cylons can automatically accomplish tasks like:
- Packet capture, protocol parsing and logging
- Active port scan and passive port discovery
- DNS poisoning
- TCP session reset and injection
- Simple client fuzzing based on TCP injection
- TLS MITM Proxy and SNI Proxy, to detect insecure TLS validation
- TLS security check, to detect outdated ciphersuites, versions and configurations
- Sensitive strings match over clear-text traffic
- Generating knowledge graph for network endpoints

Apart from these core functions, Cylons also offers some other convenient features, such as RESTful API interface, LuCI-based WebUI and integration of SSL Labs APIs.

Performance is an inevitable challenge for any network-oriented tools. In order to achieve decent performance without compromising security, Cylons is fully written in Rust, with little "unsafe" code. Rust also enables us to easily cross-build for different targets like ARM, AARCH64 and MIPS, which shares the same goals as OpenWRT.

Cylons is still in heavy development, we are trying to bring more features and make it more powerful and robust. One major goal is to add support for radio protocol assessments, including WiFi, BLE and Zigbee.

The stream of malicious software artifacts (malware) discovered daily by computer security professionals is a vital signal for threat intelligence, as malware bears telling clues about who active adversaries are, what their goals are, and how we can stop them.  Unfortunately, while security operations centers collect huge volumes of malware daily, this âmalware signalâ goes underutilized as a source of defensive intelligence, because organizations lack the right tools to make sense of malware at scale.

Detecting malware is difficult, and analyzing a detected piece of malware's behavior is even more difficult. Techniques for analysis generally fall into one of three camps: static analysis of the malicious binary on disk, dynamic analysis as the binary executes, or a hybrid approach using a snapshot of physical RAM taken as the malware executes. As the result of our DARPA Cyber Fast Track (CFT) funded research, we extend this third approach. We present a novel technique for leveraging information including multiple snapshots of physical RAM for malware detection and analysis. The technique is implemented as DAMM, a tool for differential analysis of malware in memory. DAMM functions by leveraging multiple snapshots of RAM, domain knowledge about known-benign in-memory artifacts, and indicators of malicious activity to present to the user a powerful view of malicious execution in memory.

﻿The security industry as a whole -- including operation centers, providers and telcos -- loves collecting data. Researchers are not different! A sort of common feeling is that the more data someone collects, the more self-confident he becomes about, say, a threat or another phenomenon. However, large volumes of data imply more processing resources needed, especially in extracting meaningful and useful information if the data is highly unstructured. As a result, manual data analysis is often the only choice, with security professionals like pen-testers, reversers and analysts processing data through tedious repetitive operations.

Given this situation, and our research lab suffering from similar problems, we have spent the first half of 2017 implementing a flexible toolkit based on open-source libraries for efficiently analyzing millions of deface pages and web incidents. Our tool, DefPloreX, uses a combination of machine-learning and visualization techniques to practically turn original unstructured data into meaningful high-level descriptions. Real-time information on incidents, breaches, attacks and vulnerabilities, for example, are efficiently processed and condensed into objects that are easily browsable -- making them suitable for efficient large-scale eCrime forensics and investigations.

DefPloreX ingests plain CSV inputs about web incidents to analyze, explores their resources with headless browsers, extracts features from deface pages, and uploads the resulting data to an Elastic index. Distributed headless browsers are coordinated via Celery. Using Python Panda, NumPy and PyTables, DefPloreX provides offline "views" of the data, allowing easy pivoting and exploration. Our toolkit automatically groups similar deface pages in clusters and organizes web incidents in campaigns. Requiring only one pass, clustering is intrinsically parallel and not memory bound. DefPloreX offers text- and web-based UIs, which can be queried using a simple language for investigations and forensics.

DET aims to provide a framework to assist with exfiltrating data using either one or several channels. Social media has become extremely popular in recent attacks such as HammerToss, campaign uncovered by FireEye in July 2015. Several tools are also publicly available allowing you to remotely access computers through "legitimate" services such as Gmail (GCat) or Twitter (Twittor). Often gaining access to a network is just the first step for a targeted attacker. Once inside, the goal is to go after sensitive information and exfiltrate it to servers under their control. To prevent this from occuring, a whole industry has popped up with the aim of stopping exfiltration attacks. However, often these are expensive and rarely work as expected. With this in mind, I created the Data Exfiltration Toolkit (DET) to help both penetration testers testing deployed security devices and those admins who've installed and configured them, to ensure they are working as expected and detecting when sensitive data is leaving the network.

Often gaining access to a network is just the first step for a targeted attacker. Once inside, the goal is to go after sensitive information and exfiltrate it to servers under their control. To prevent this from occuring, a whole industry has popped up with the aim of stopping exfiltration attacks. However, often these are expensive and rarely work as expected. With this in mind, I created the Data Exfiltration Toolkit (DET) to help both penetration testers testing deployed security devices and those admins who've installed and configured them, to ensure they are working as expected and detecting when sensitive data is leaving the network.


### [DIAL - Did I Alert Lambda? Centralised Security Misconfiguration Detection Framework](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
Workloads on the cloud provide equal opportunities for hackers as much as they do for internal teams. Cloud-native companies are open to attacks from both outside forces and from within. With the ever-growing risk of a security breach and cloud misconfiguration being one of the most common factors of the same, the mean time to detect is supposed to be reduced to seconds instead of minutes/hours.

DIAL, or "Did I just alert Lambda?", is a cutting-edge security monitoring and alerting system that provides centralized visibility and analysis of potential internal threats and security misconfigurations across multiple AWS accounts. By leveraging the stateless nature of AWS Lambda, DIAL enables easy modular deployment and makes it highly scalable and cost-efficient, making it an efficient and effective tool for detecting and mitigating security risks.

It's an event-driven framework, because of which detection time for identifying any security misconfiguration is less than 4 secs whereas traditional SIEM detection time for misconfigurations is more than 5-7 minutes and It can easily be deployed in any organization using its cloud formation stack.

With DIAL, you can deploy a central security monitoring solution on your AWS accounts for pennies compared to deploying a traditional SIEM solution and can gain end-to-end visibility of their AWS infrastructure and receive timely alerts on issues like public database exposure and over-permissive IAM policies, helping them to proactively safeguard their systems and data.

### [Deep Exploit](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
DeepExploit is fully automated penetration tool linked with Metasploit. It identifies the status of all opened ports on the target server and executes the exploit at pinpoint using Machine Learning.

Deep Exploit's key features are the following:

Self-learning: DeepExploit can learn how to exploitation by itself (uses reinforcement learning). It is not necessary for humans to prepare learning data.
Efficiently execute exploit: DeepExploit can execute exploits at pinpoint (minimum 1 attempt) using self-learned data.
Deep penetration: If DeepExploit succeeds the exploit to the target server, it further executes the exploit to other internal servers.
Operation is very easy: Your only operation is to input one command. It is very easy!
Learning time is very fast: DeepExploit uses distributed learning by multi agents. So, we adopted an advanced machine learning model called A3C.

Current Deep Exploit's version is a beta, but it can fully automatically execute following actions:

Intelligence gathering
Threat modeling
Vulnerability analysis
Exploitation
Post-Exploitation
Reporting

By using our DeepExploit, you will benefit from the following:

For pentesters: (a) They can greatly improve the test efficiency; (b) The more pentesters use DeepExploit, DeepExploit learns how to method of exploitation using machine learning. As a result, accuracy of test can be improve.
For Information Security Officers: (c) They can quickly identify vulnerabilities of own servers. As a result, prevent that attackers attack to your servers using vulnerabilities, and protect your reputation by avoiding the negative media coverage after breach.

Because attack methods to servers are evolving day by day, there is no guarantee that yesterday's security countermeasures are safety today. It is necessary to quickly find vulnerabilities and take countermeasures. Our DeepExploit will contribute greatly to keep your safety.

Sometimes you want to be able to pull forensic images off your production hosts, but you want to make sure you set that up correctly. If you don't, people might steal customer financial data or cryptocurrency private keys for hot wallets (or something else), and that would be a very bad day for you and for the cryptocurrency community. This talk introduces Dexter, a forensics tool for high security environments. Dexter makes sure that no single person can do scary forensics things, and that the scary results of the scary forensic things can only be read by people who aren't scary. I'll give an overview of the Coinbase production environment, data pipeline, and detection tooling to set the stage for when we might use Dexter. We will then walk through how Dexter works and do a demo that will totally work and not have any technical issues whatsoever.

Today's digital ecosystem is harboring digital diseases that are increasingly resistant to antiviral measures. Many information security professionals continue to address the malware (digital disease pathogen) threat by focusing on antiviral methods and the re-imaging of infected hosts. The prevalence of infection is not conducive to the old reactive vaccination paradigm of one antidote signature for all. Can we learn from epidemiologists and how they investigate biological diseases? How do we enable more people to help in this digital medical crisis? We know there aren't enough people working on the digital disease problem, so how do we increase the numbers? This Digital Disease Control Web-Based Tracking app is an alpha proof of concept visualization tool, inspired by epidemiology, to enable entry level technicians to enter the security field.

![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
Dracon is an open source, Application and Cloud Security Orchestration and Correlation (ASOC) platform, empowering organisations to establish and manage comprehensive application security programs. By creating customizable pipelines, Dracon enables the execution of a wide range of security tools against any target. During a pipeline execution Dracon runs user-configured tools in parallel. Concurrently, results from each tool are deduplicated, enriched with information based on organisational or regulatory policies, compliance requirements, and more, before being forwarded to any visualisation or data processing sink.
The primary objective of Dracon is to offer a scalable and flexible framework that enables execution of arbitrary security tools on code and infrastructure while processing the results in a versatile manner. Under the hood, Dracon runs parallel user-configured security tools(Producer Stage), aggregates, and transforms the results into an internal format.
Once results are normalised, Dracon can apply user defined information enrichment. An enricher is custom code that allows users to enhance the information presented based on internal policies and compliance requirements. Out of the box, Dracon supports Deduplication, Policy and SBOM information enrichers, while writing a new enricher is made easy for the user with the help of provided libraries.
Finally, Dracon directs enriched results to a layer of user-configurable Consumers. A consumer can be any data visualisation, alerting or vulnerability management solution. This powerful, extensible platform simplifies security engineering and enables organisations to strengthen their cybersecurity posture.

### [Droid-FF: Android Fuzzing Framework](#)  
![BH-US-16](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-US-16-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
Droid-FF is the very first Android fuzzing framework which helps researchers find memory corruption bugs written in c /c ++ â It comes as a VM which is ready to go and easy to work with. Why Droid-FF ? Native code is preferred over JIT languages due to their memory efficiency and speed, but security bugs within native code can result in exploits that can take over the Android system . The goal of the fuzzer is help researchers find security bugs by fuzzing Android.What does it do?Data Generation Currently includes Peach, with some pre-populated pit files, which helps in generating data be it "dex,ttf,png,avi,mp4" etcApproaches a . Dumb fuzzing: From a large input section of valid data , the fuzzer generates new data with mutations in place. b. Intelligent Fuzzing: We create a file format representation of the target data and let the fuzzer generate data which is structurally valid, but has invalid data in sections.Fuzzing System The fuzzing system is an automated program which runs the dataset against the target program and deals with any error conditions that can possibly happen. It also maintains state so that we could resume the fuzzing from the right place in an event of a crash.Advanced Triage System In the event of a valid crash, the triage system collects the tombstone files which contains the dump of the registers and system state with detailed information. It also collects valid logs and the file responsible for the crash and moves it to the triage database. The triage database runs scripts on the data derived from crashes, like the type pf the crash, for eg : SIGSEGV, the PC address at this crash and checks for any duplicate, if found, the duplicate entry is removed and is moved to crashes for investigation.What we're using during this lab? The android system which we are going to fuzz is an Engineering build from AOSP which has symbols, thus in an event of a crash, it will be much easier to triage the crash. The system supports fuzzing real devices, emulators , and images running on virtual box. How Efficient is this Framework? We ran the fuzzer in Intelligent fuzzing mode with mp4 structure fed in for 14 hours on the stagefright binary and it was able to reproduce 3 crashes which were exploitable ( CVE's) and lots of un-interesting crashes mostly dude to out of memory, duplicates or null pointers.Goals of the FrameworkMake Fuzzing Easy and available for allCompletely open source and extensibleMake android eco-system more secure

![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
The rise of commercial drones/Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) has dramatically changed several industries and our daily lives. This emergence is also challenging our concept of safety, security, privacy and regulation. With their ability to amass data and transport loads, drones are changing our views about our physical environment. Commercial drones are now used for surveying, inspecting and imaging with more technological advancements being pushed out by active communities of hobbyists and enthusiasts. Although their commercial use has been criticised by both individuals and activist organisations, this tension presents unique challenges to integration in the current public, government and private sectors. Recent incidents regarding drone disruptions and malicious activities has further cemented the fact that there is a lack in control and regulation of drones. Thus, we created DMTS as an automated drone-to-drone solution that hopefully helps to alleviate our regulatory and physical security needs.

### [EMBA – From firmware to exploit](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
IoT (Internet of Things) and OT (Operational Technology) are the current buzzwords for networked devices on which our modern society is based on. In this area, the used operating systems are summarized with the term firmware. The devices themselves, also called embedded devices, are essential in the private and industrial environments as well as in the so-called critical infrastructure.

Penetration testing of these systems is quite complex as we have to deal with different architectures, optimized operating systems, and special protocols. EMBA is an open-source firmware analyzer with the goal to simplify and optimize the complex task of firmware security analysis. EMBA supports the penetration tester with the automated detection of 1-day vulnerabilities on a binary level. This goes far beyond the plain CVE detection: With EMBA you always know which public exploits are available for the target firmware. Besides the detection of already known vulnerabilities, EMBA also supports the tester on the next 0-day. For this, EMBA identifies critical binary functions, protection mechanisms, and services with network behavior on a binary level. There are many other features built into EMBA, such as fully automated firmware extraction, finding file system vulnerabilities, hard-coded credentials, and more.

EMBA is the open-source firmware scanner, created by penetration testers for penetration testers.

### [EVILSPLOIT – A UNIVERSAL HARDWARE HACKING TOOLKIT - ARSENAL THEATER DEMO](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
Hardware hacking is about to understand the inner working mechanism of hardware. Most of the time, the hardware hacking process starts from reversing. From the hardware point of view, reversing in static way includes uncovering the schematic and disassembling the binary. On the other hand, reversing in dynamic way includes finding a way to debug the hardware and to fuzz it accordingly. In practice, it is almost a standard operating procedure to obtain the binary of the hardware and reverse it consequently. As a supplementary technique for static binary reversing, debugging allows the real hardware operation process to be demystified in run time. In fact, the binary itself can be obtained by applying debugging technique- while it is not available from manufacturer. So, it is crucial to figure out the provisioning ports of the hardware in order to start performing hardware hacking. The conventional approach to identify provisioning ports is by using pin finder toolkits such as Jtagulator. However, it is impractical and inefficient once a provisioning port has been found; another toolkit such as Shikra has to be used to manipulate the provisioning port. It is not only prone to error, but not hacker-friendly. So, it is important to find a way to fill the gap between provisioning port identification and manipulation processes. With this, it allows the hardware hacking process to be automated by making it scriptable in high level. We will present a new method to allow provisioning port identification and manipulation by using connection matrix. With this, it is possible to construct arbitrary analog-alike connection in array form to implement all pattern of interconnect between bus interfacing chip and the target. Hence, once the appropriate provisioning port has been figured out, in the meantime, it is ready to be used for debugging or firmware dumping purposes. Besides, it is also an ideal assistive toolset for unknown signal analysis, side channel analysis (SCA), and fault injection (FI).

IoT is an emerging field exploding with new products and innovation. The security of IoT products is still lagging behind for various reasons. One of the important reasons from security researcher's perspective is the availability of security tools. If you have been pentesting IoT products, you would agree that there are too many different tools required for the job and there is no single silver bullet. And when it comes to Smart Infrastructure, we do not have any existing solutions similar to IT penetration testing tools.
We started looking at the learning curve and tools required for IoT security research and decided to create a framework that will enable the research community to speed up their research and pentesting effort. Meet expliot (pronounced - explaayotee) an open source IoT security testing and exploitation framework, right now in Beta phase, it will provide the building block for writing exploits and other IoT security assessment test cases with ease by making it simple for security researchers to create and execute simple to complex mis-use cases using the framework. The objective of the framework is:

Dropping a payload or malware onto a target is usually not an issue given the variety of vulnerable software in use. Your challenge is keeping the payload from working and spreading to unintended targets, eventually leading to reverse engineers, crowdsourced or professional, who pick apart your work, and start an industry to stop your success. Inspiration for the tool came from the effective use of environmental keying in Gauss malware (2012) that, to this day, has prevented the reverse engineering community around the world from determining the purpose and use of all operational modules used in various industry attacks [https://securelist.com/blog/incidents/33561/the-mystery-of-the-encrypted-gauss-payload-5/].Our framework, Ebowla [https://github.com/Genetic-Malware/Ebowla], implements techniques above and beyond those found in Gauss or Flashback to keep your payload from detection and analysis. Currently we support three protection mechanisms: AES file based keying, AES environmental based keying, and One Time Pad (closer to a digital book cipher) based off a known file on the target's system. The protected payloads are generated with either a stand-alone python or golang in-memory loader for the target system.


### [ElastAlert](#)  
![BH-US-15](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-US-15-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
ElastAlert is a simple framework for alerting on anomalies, spikes, or other patterns of interest from data in Elasticsearch. It works by combining Elasticsearch with two types of modular components, rule types and alerts. Elasticsearch is periodically queried and the data is passed to the rule type, which determines when a match is found. When a match occurs, it is given to one or more alerts, which take action based on the match.


### [Elastic Handler](#)  
![BH-US-16](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-US-16-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
Elastic Handler is a DFIR specific replacement for the LogstashElastic Handler allows you to take all the tools you currently run and make their output better by doing the following:It allows you to define a mapping from the CSV/TSV/Etc output you are getting now into JSON so that ES can ingest itIt allows you to normalize all of the data you are feeding in so that your column names are suddenly the same allowing cross reporting searching and correlation.It lets you harness the extreme speed of Elastic Search to do the heavy listing in your correlationIt lets you take a unified view of your data/report to automate that analysis and create spreadsheets/etc. that you would have spent a day on previouslyThe idea here is to let computers do what can be automated so you can spend more time using what makes humans special. What I mean by that is your analyst brains and experience to spot patterns, trends and meaning from the output of the reports. In the GitHub repository there are several mappings provided for the tools, we call out most like; Tzworks tools, Shellbag explorer, our link parser, Mandiant's Shimcache parser, etc. But the cool thing about this framework is that to bring in another report, all you have to do is generate two text files to define your mapping, there is no code involved.

The analysis of malware behavior in network activity and event logs is a costly and time-consuming task. Even with automated techniques, inspection of network traffic in tools such as Wireshark is often tedious and overwhelming due to the many packet details.

We need faster techniques to speedup the discovery of malware activity and gain insight in our event logs by combining machine learning and visualization together. To this end we developed "Eventpad - the notepad editor for event data", a tool that enables analysts to quickly analyze network traffic by exploiting the human mind. Eventpad is a visual analytics tool that enables analysts to visually inspect system events as blocks on a screen. Just like a notepad editor find&replace, conditional formatting, and rewrite functionality can be used to accurately search and highlight system vulnerabilities in these block collections. Together with automated techniques such as clustering and multiple sequence alignment analysts can quickly drill down and extract nontrivial patterns and threat indicators from network conversations and event logs.

We demonstrate how we can use Eventpad to quickly discover patterns in PCAP DPI traffic. In particular, we give live demos on how we can use the tool to discover protocol misusage in VoIP traffic and reverse engineer Ransomware viruses in back office environments.

![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
Analyzing Firmware specifically to identify potential vulnerabilities is a common activity for security analysts, pentesters, researchers or engineers concerned with embedded devices such as in IoT. FACT offers an automated and usable platform to gain an immediate overview of potential vulnerabilities based on the firmware of a device and supercharges the process of finding deep vulnerabilities.

For this FACT automatically breaks down a firmware into its components, analyzes all components and summarizes the results. The analysis can then be perused in the desired amount of detail using either the responsive web application or a REST API.

The offered analyses include a list of included software and libraries, a matching of said software to CVE databases, identification of hard-coded credentials, private key material and weak configuration among others. FACT also applies source and binary code analysis to identify (possibly exploitable) bugs in the components and offers a large amount of meta data for further manual analysis.

A focus of recent development has been to offer more information regarding interdependencies between firmware components to ease the identification of data flow inside a firmware. This allows quickly grading the risk involved with uncovered vulnerabilities or configuration flaws by finding possible attack vectors concerning given component.

Finally, FACT offers multiple ways to collect and fuse analysis results, such as firmware comparison, advanced search options including regular expression on binary components and an integrated statistics module.

However, there is no such toolkit, which helps an embedded or IoT security researcher to analyse firmwares in an in-depth level. FAT or Firmware Analysis Toolkit is a scriptable toolkit suite is a part of Attify's internal pentesting suite which has helped us reduce a significant number of man hours put into firmware analysis in our IoT and smart devices pentest engagements. It comes with an easy to use API which can then be used in additional analysis, as well as for research purposes. It is a toolkit suite which performs static and dynamic analysis of firmwares, also enabling the user to emulate the firmware and having a live firmware device as if a real physical device was sitting on the network. This has been done by taking advantage of Qemu emulation and static vulnerability identification techniques. Below are some of the capabilities of the toolkit : Full emulation of the firmware along with networking Dynamic traffic analysis Static vulnerability identification Integration with tools such as nmap and metasploit for additional assessment and exploitation

By Black Hat EU, there might be more features added to the list which I will later on send once they are in a more concrete stage. FAT has been made possible because of the following open source tools listed below, which FAT leverages at various stages:


### [FLOSS](#)  
![BH-EU-16](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-EU-16-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
The FireEye Labs Obfuscated String Solver (FLOSS) is an open source tool that automatically detects, extracts, and decodes obfuscated strings in Windows Portable Executable (PE) files. Malware analysts, forensic investigators, and incident responders can use FLOSS to quickly extract sensitive strings to identify indicators of compromise (IOCs).

Malware authors encode strings in their programs to hide malicious capabilities and impede reverse engineering. Even simple encoding schemes defeat the 'strings' tool and complicate static and dynamic analysis. FLOSS uses advanced static analysis techniques, such as emulation, to deobfuscate encoded strings.

FLOSS is extremely easy to use and works against a large corpus of malware. It follows a similar invocation as the 'strings' tool. Users that understand how to interpret the strings found in a binary will understand FLOSS's output. FLOSS extracts higher value strings, as strings that are obfuscated typically contain the most sensitive configuration resources â€" including C2 server addresses, names of dynamically resolved imports, suspicious file paths, and other IOCs. I will describe the computer science that powers the tool, and why it works. I will also show how to use FLOSS and demonstrate the decoding of strings from a wide variety of malware families.

### [Falco + Falcosidekick = A Kubernetes Response Engine](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
Falco is the CNCF open-source project for runtime threat detection for containers and Kubernetes. It was created by Sysdig in 2016 and is the first runtime security project to join CNCF as an incubation-level project.

Falco is a container security tool designed to detect anomalous activity in your local machine, container, cloud, a managed Kubernetes cluster, or a Kubernetes cluster such as K3s. It taps into system calls and Kubernetes Audit logs to generate an event stream of all system activity.

One of the benefits of Falco is in leveraging its powerful and flexible rules language. As a result, Falco will generate security events when it finds abnormal behaviors as defined by a customizable set of rules. Meanwhile, Falco comes with a handful of out-of-the-box detection rules.

The Falco community is strong and active, contributing largely to not only the project but methods in which folks can find threats and feed whatever method they choose with examples! Falcosidekick was born providing an easy to use UI to Falco and an enhanced available outputs. Falcosidekick even provides a response engine utilizing serverless (lambda, knative, kubeless, openfaas) which extends capabilities to whatever the security team wants to create remediation functions for with examples such as stopping a container, memdump, etc etc.


### [Faraday v3 - Collaborative Penetration Test and Vulnerability Management Platform](#)  
![BH-ASIA-18](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ASIA-18-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
The idea behind Faraday is to help you to share all the information that is generated during a pentest, vulnerability assessment or scan without changing the way you work. You run a command, import a report, and Faraday will normalize the results and share them with the rest of the team in real-time. Faraday has more than 60 plugins available (and counting), including the most popular commercial and open-source tools. If you use a tool that Faraday doesn't have a plugin for, you can create your own! During this presentation we're going to release Faraday v3.0 with all the new features that we were working on for the last couple of months that include a huge back-end change. Come check it out!


### [FARADAY](#)  
![BH-EU-16](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-EU-16-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
Since collaborative pentesting is more common each day and teams become larger, sharing the information between pentesters can become a difficult task. Different tools, different formats, long outputs (in the case of having to audit a large network) can make it almost impossible. You may end up with wasted efforts, duplicated tasks, a lot of text files scrambled in your working directory. And then, you need to collect that same information from your teammates and write a report for your client, trying to be as clear as possible.

The idea behind Faraday is to help you to share all the information that is generated during the pentest, without changing the way you work. You run a command, or import a report, and Faraday will normalize the results and share that with the rest of the team in real time. Faraday has more than 50 plugins available (and counting), including a lot of common tools. And if you use a tool for which Faraday doesn't have a plugin, you can create your own. During this presentation we're going release Faraday v2.0 with all the new features that we were working on for the last couple of months.

### [GAME OF DRONES: PUTTING THE EMERGING 'DRONE DEFENSE' MARKET TO THE TEST - ARSENAL THEATER DEMO](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
When you learned that military and law enforcement agencies had trained screaming eagles to pluck drones from the sky, did you too find yourself asking: "I wonder if I could throw these eagles off my tail, maybe by deploying delicious bacon countermeasures?" Well, you'd be wise to question just how effective these emerging, first generation 'drone defense' solutions really are, and which amount to little more than 'snake oil.'

There is no such thing as "best practices" when it comes to defending against 'rogue drones' – period. Over the past 2 years, new defensive products that detect and respond to 'rogue drones' have been crawling out of the woodwork. The vast majority are immature, unproven solutions that require a proper vetting.

We've taken a MythBusters-style approach to testing the effectiveness of a variety of drone defense solutions, pitting them against our DangerDrone. Videos demonstrating the results should be almost as fun for you to watch as they were for us to produce. Expect to witness epic aerial battles against an assortment of drone defense types, including:

Trained eagles and falcons that hunt 'rogue drones'
Fighter drones that hunt and shoot nets
Drones with large nets that swoop in and snatch up 'rogue drones'
Surface-to-air projectile weapons, including bazooka-like cannons that launch nets, and shotgun shells containing nets
Signal jamming and hijacking devices that attack drone command and control interfaces
Even frickin' laser beams and Patriot missiles!

We'll also be releasing DangerDrone v2.0, an upgraded version of our free Raspberry Pi-based pentesting quadcopter (basically a ~$500 hacker's laptop… that can also fly). We'll be giving away a fully functional DangerDrone v2.0 to one lucky audience member! Come see what's guaranteed to be the most entertaining talk this year and find out which of these dogs can hunt!


### [GDBFuzz: Embedded Fuzzing with Hardware Breakpoints](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
In this tool demo, we will present GDBFuzz, a new open source fuzzer that leverages hardware breakpoints and program analysis to test embedded systems. Existing fuzzers for embedded devices most often run on an emulation of the code, but GDBFuzz runs on the device itself. This allows GDBFuzz to fuzz devices which do not have emulations. Its integration with Ghidra allows it to fuzz closed-source applications. All the tool needs is access to the commonly used GDB remote protocol.

We will explain how GDBFuzz combines hardware breakpoints with control flow relationships to guide fuzzing exploration. We will also detail its underlying analyses and techniques that were recently published at the academic conference ISSTA. GDBFuzz detected three previously unknown bugs in open-source embedded software that were confirmed by the vendors. GDBFuzz is the first tool allowing to fuzz embedded systems at scale.

To demonstrate the fuzzer's ease of use and efficiency, we will run an interactive demo on multiple devices (including ARM and MSP430 processors). At the end of the session, attendees will know how to use GDBFuzz to test their own embedded systems.

### [GyoiThon](#)  
![BH-ASIA-18](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ASIA-18-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
GyoiThon is a growing penetration test tool using Deep Learning. Deep Learning improves classification accuracy in proportion to the amount of learning data. Therefore, GyoiThon will be taking in new learning data during every scan. Since GyoiThon uses various features of software included in HTTP response as learning data, the more you scan, the more the accuracy of software detection improves. For this reason, GyoiThon is a growing penetration test tool.GyoiThon identifies the software installed on web server (OS, Middleware, Framework, CMS, etc...) based on the learning data. After that, GyoiThon executes valid exploits for the identified software. GyoiThon automatically generates reports of scan results. GyoiThon executes the above processing automatically.GyoiThon consists of three engines:Software analysis engine - It identifies software based on HTTP response obtained by normal access to web server using Deep Learning base and signature base.Vulnerability determination engine - It collects vulnerability information corresponding to identify software by the software analysis engine. And, the engine executes an exploit corresponding to the vulnerability of the software and checks whether the software is affected by the vulnerability.Report generation engine - It generates a report that summarizes the risks of vulnerabilities and the countermeasure.Traditional penetration testing tools are very inefficient because they execute all signatures; however, unlike traditional penetration testing tools, GyoiThon is very efficient because it executes only valid exploits for the identified software. As a result, the user's burden will be greatly reduce, and GyoiThon will greatly contribute to the security improvement of many web servers.


### [GyoiThon: Penetration Testing Using Machine Learning](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
In GyioThon released at Black Hat Asia 2018 Arsenal, we used Deep Learning to enable us to identify products that traditional penetration test tools could not identify. In the original GyoiThon, as well as in other tools, it has always been necessary for someone to investigate product-specific features and signature generation with continuous updates, which we've been working to update to make easier. GyoiThon is the growing penetration test tool using Deep Learning. Deep Learning improves classification accuracy in proportion to the amount of learning data. Therefore GyoiThon will be taking in new learning data every scanning. Since GyoiThon uses various features of software included in HTTP response as learning data, you scan more, the accuracy of software detection improves. For this reason, GyoiThon is the growing penetration test tool.

GyoiThon identifies the software installed on web server (OS, Middleware, Framework, CMS, etc...) based on the learning data. After that, GyoiThon executes valid exploits for the identified software. GyoiThon automatically generates reports of scan results. GyoiThon executes the above processing fully automatically.

GyoiThon's major updates:
- Automatically generates the signature to identify various products.
- Can generate signatures necessary for product identification by even users without Deep Learning knowledge using Deep Learning. You no longer have to investigate product-specific features. You no longer need to create a signature, because GyoiThon itself can generate signatures fully automatically.

GyoiThon is the first penetration test tool that made it possible to generate signatures automatically. GyoiThon is evolving as the growing penetration test tool. For further details: https://github.com/gyoisamurai/GyoiThon/blob/master/handout/BHA2018_handout.pdf

### [HACK/400 AND IBMISCANNER TOOLING FOR CHECKING YOUR IBM I (AKA AS/400) MACHINES!](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
In many industries the back-end systems still rely on "heavy" machines such as IBM i (aka AS/400) for core transactional systems. However, this area remained rather uncovered by security researchers. Back in 2015 I presented certain weaknesses of IBM i security at DefCon 23, providing a demo tool for assessment of IBM i systems and exploitation of some weaknesses, like privilege escalation. Since 2015, we improved the tool making it more useful for security personnel and auditors to assess certain important aspects of IBM i system security. These developments led to also adding new functionality in famous cracking tool, John the Ripper, for AS/400 password hashes. Based on users' feedback we try to make it best of class tooling for security assessments, keeping it open source (GPL) for the community.

### [HARDSPLOIT: LIKE METASPLOIT BUT FOR HARDWARE HACKING](#)  
![BH-EU-15](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-EU-15-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
Why we chose to create HardSploit: It is clear that something is needed to help the security community to evaluate, audit and/or control the level of security in embedded systems.
HardSploit is a complete tool box (hardware & software), a framework which aims to:
- Facilitate the auditing of electronic systems for industry 'security' workers (consultants, auditors, pentesters, product designers, etc.)
- Increase the level of security (and trust!) of new products designed by the industry
HardSploit Modules & Framework:
Hardsploit is an all-in-one tool hardware pentest tool with software and electronic aspects. This is a technical and modular platform (using FPGA) to perform security tests on electronic communications interfaces of embedded devices.
The main hardware security audit functions are:
- Sniffer
- Scanner
- Interact
- Dump memory

Hardsploit's Modules will let hardware pentesters intercept, replay and/or send data via each type of electronic bus used by the hardware target. The level of interaction that pentesters will have depends on the features of the electronic bus.

Hardsploit's Modules further enable you to analyze electronic bus (serial and parallel types), JTAG, SPI, I2C's, parallel addresses & data bus on chip.

Assisted Visual Wiring Function:
No more stress with that tremendous part of Hardware pen testing: You will know what needs to be connected and where!
We integrated into the tool an assisted visual wiring function to help you connect your wires to the hardware target:
- GUI will display the pin organization (Pin OUT) of the targeted chip.
- GUI will guide you throughout the wiring process between Hardsploit Connector and the target
- GUI will control a set of LEDs that will turn ON and OFF to easily let you find the right Hardsploit Pin Connector to connect to your target

The software part of the project will help to conduct an end-to-end security audit and will be compatible (integrated) with existing tools such as Metasploit. We will offer integration with other APIs in the future.
Our ambition is to provide a tool equivalent to those of the company Qualys or Nessus (Vulnerability Scanner) or the Metasploit framework but in the domain of embedded systems/electronics.

![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
It is astonishingly easy as an attacker to move around on most networks undetected. Let's face it, unless your organization is big enough to have full packet capture with some expensive IDS, you will likely have no idea if there is an attacker on your network. What are the options for home users and small businesses? What if there were a cheap Raspberry Pi device you could plug into your network that masquerades as a juicy target to hackers?

HoneyPi attempts to offer a reliable indicator of compromise with little to no setup or maintenance costs. There are tons of honeypot options out there, but we leveraged our experience in penetration testing to answer the question "What sorts of activities could be flagged that we generally do when attacking a network?"

That is why HoneyPi tries to keep it simple compared to other honeypots. HoneyPi only flags the three surefire triggers that would catch most attackers:

Port Scanning Activities
RDP Connection Attempts
SMB Connection Attempts

Wrap up this simplicity in a way that is designed to be deployed on a RaspberryPi and you've got a simple honeypot that you can add to your network to get insight when you are under attack.


### [HOOKA: Deep Dive Into ART(Android Runtime) For Dynamic Binary Analysis](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
Google has changed Android runtime drastically each time a new version of Android is released to optimize the performance, storage usage, and system updates of apps. The profiling data has started to be generated in the recent version of Android 10, based on the user's behavior in ART (Android Runtime). Based on the profiling data, the byte code is optimized (Profile-Guided optimization and Cloud Profile optimization) by the compiler (AOT/JIT). ART also interprets and executes different types of code (byte code, oat code, and jit code) generated by the compiler. Such complexity in the structure and the operation method makes ART difficult to understand correctly. However, since all the code of the app is interpreted and executed through ART, if the attacker understands how ART works, it is possible to steal all the information necessary to analyze the app. Therefore, in this paper, we analyze the flow and structure of how the app code is interpreted and executed by objects existing in Android 10 ART. Then, by modifying the ART based on the analysis results, we develop a framework that can steal the information in real-time, such as smali code, interface, parameters, return value, fields, and stack trace of a method that is executed dynamically. In addition, we present an easy technique to effectively analyze the app without accessing the execution code by using tools such as decompiler or disassembler.

In existing debugger or hooking frameworks that dynamically analyze the apps in the Android environment, it is forcibly attached to the target analysis process, and the code is injected to read or analyze the code in the memory area while the execution code is loaded in memory. Since these methods are blocked by RASP (Runtime Application Self Protection), it takes a lot of time for attackers or analysts to bypass it and analyze the app.

The method proposed in this paper, on the other hand, analyzes the app by modifying the ART (Android Runtime) itself which is responsible for loading and executing the app's execution code in memory in Android. Even if any Anti-Hooking and Anti-Debugging techniques are applied to the app, all the codes are eventually executed through ART. This allows us to dump the dynamically executed code as smali code without being detected by RASP. In addition, all runtime information (such as stack trace, args, return value, etc.) of running functions can be captured and used for the analysis.

This technique is basically to redevelop ART in Android. Most similar methods that change the system modules in Android build the Android OS in debug mode. This makes such approach with the system modification more easily detectable by RASP.
However, the method proposed in this presentation bypasses AVB (Android Verified Boot) and SafetyNet in the kernel, and then patch only the ART module from Stock Rom released by Google. Therefore, I present an effective method to easily analyze apps without being detected by RASP.

Do you feel the needâ¦ the need for speed? Then check out our brand new penetration testing drone. This Raspberry Pi based copter is both cheap and easy to create on your own, making it the first practical drone solution for your pentesting needs. Drones have emerged as the prevailing weapon of choice in modern warfare, so it's only logical that we'd also explore the potential applications of this formidable tool in cyber warfare. While there have been presentations before on weaponizing drones for the purposes of pentesting, these efforts were not easily replicated by anyone other than experienced drone aficionados with several thousands of dollars to spend â ultimately resulting in somewhat clunky, partial solutions. Conditions have finally matured enough to where pentesters who are inexperienced with drones can get up and running fairly quickly and spending only a couple hundred dollars on a Raspberry Pi based drone copter solution. Our talk will be aimed at this target audience, helping equip pentesters with drone tools of the future.In this talk, we'll demonstrate how this drone can be used to perform aerial recon, attack wireless infrastructure and clients, land on a target facility roof, and serve as a persistent backdoor. In fact, we'll show you how to attack 'over the air' protocols such as RFID, ZigBee, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and more. We'll even demo a special edition "RickMote Danger Drone" that you can use to patrol your neighborhood and rickroll Google Chromecast-connected TVs.Additionally, we will showcase the best-of-breed in hardware and software that you'll need. This will include the release of our custom Raspberry Pi SD card image, parts list, 3D print objects, and necessary instructions for you to create a Danger Drone of your own. We'll also be giving away a fully functional Danger Drone to one lucky audience member - guaranteed to leave your friends feeling peanut butter and jealous! This DEMO-rich presentation will benefit both newcomers and seasoned professionals of drone and physical penetration testing fields.

![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
Mainstream mobile phone systems have implemented privacy features that allow users to keep an eye on how apps access their data, such as Privacy Dashboard for Android and App Privacy Report for iOS. However, while we delved into the implementation of these systems, we found that it was not as accurate and credible as expected. We developed our offline App privacy leak detection platform - Hooke, to identify privacy-sensitive behaviors much more clearly and directly.

For data access, we identified over 300 privacy-related APIs across 8 categories for both Android and iOS, and we constructed sandbox environments and added instrumentation to collect runtime information like parameters, stack traces and app status. For network behavior, we found a general solution to bypass ssl pinning, and tried to decrypt network traffic to prevent sensitive data escape. To facilitate locating privacy issues, our sandbox also recorded App runtime screens and timestamps during the test phase, which are associated directly with dynamic behaviors.

Our tool, Hooke, shows App behaviors in the aspect of privacy data access, network traffic and screen recordings, and we also implemented an intelligent rule engine to analyze this data. Finally, these three categories data are associated and presented in the form of a timeline, aiming to directly and easily locate an App's behavior throughout the app's lifecycle by dragging the timeline. With the help of Hooke, we found dozens of privacy leak issues hidden in malicious Apps and third-party SDKs.﻿

Horus is a scanning engine for mobile security mainly used to detect security risks of binary library, including detection of binary vulnerabilities and malicious behavior. Horus is currently used within Alipay Inc. It is designed as a rule-based framework. As many mobile apps use a large number of third-party libraries - such as libopenssl, libffmpeg and so on - Horus supports security detection of various types of binary libraries. New product or new task connects to it by calling the interface. By adding and removing defined rules (CVE,patch,txt), the user will get a distribution or matching statistic for vulnerability, backdoor or malicious activity, etc. Now,It matches rules at different level: binary function level, binary pattern level and binary instruction level.Horus has resolved thousands of application security risks and help us improve the security of applications effectively and reliably. We want to open this security scanning engine through Arsenal. We hope to improve matching algorithms and performance of Horus in the future with more ai power inside. We also hope more and more security developers can work together to improve Horus.


### [Hunting Wargames with Arthur and Merlin in IOC-Land](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
APT reports and IOC updates are flowing in, piling up in your inbox. You forward them to your IR team, or curate and compile a digest if you are lucky enough to have a budget for a dedicated threat intel team. Everyone talks about tracking bad guys and creating threat intel, but - how many organizations are equipped to consume threat intel today? Everyone is pitching new IOCs but is how many are really catching?

The real question is - if you got all the answers to the APT riddle right now, would you be able to scope and respond effectively?
Do you have the tools and process in place, and trained your people to be able to leverage threat intel the moment it becomes available, and how can you know for sure that you are prepared and it will all work at the moment of truth? And how do you verify that your queries, rules and IOC scans would actually find anything?

This presentation will release a new automated system for testing the IOC consumption capability of an enterprise. Borrowing a page or two from modern software development and computer science theory, this system is built in the model of a prover (Merlin) and a verifier (Arthur).

The presentation will include a live demo of the system on a real environment. Finally, the code to implement this process will be open sourced on Github, so that the community can use it, expand on the initial features and contribute their improvements.

### [ID2T - THE INTRUSION DETECTION DATASET GENERATION TOOLKIT](#)  
![BH-EU-17](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-EU-17-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
There is a never-ending arms race between attackers and defenders in the cyber-security world. Our tool, ID2T, tries to leverage the balance of power towards the defenders' side. ID2T enables security researchers and practitioners to test their defensive tools against synthetic attacks without risks. By injecting synthetic, yet realistic, attacks into network traces, detection mechanisms can be audited, tested and evaluated.

ID2T emerges from the gaps that exist between the arsenals of attackers and defenders. Attackers have the upper hand with 0-day exploits and the malware that utilizes them. Ransomware, for example, makes the headlines more often than ever. The development of modern security mechanisms, on the contrary, is moving slowly. One of the reasons for the slow pace is that there are no clear strategies to evaluate novel defensive proposals. Researchers and security practitioners are forced to use archaic and unrealistic network traces to evaluate their proposals. The DARPA 1999 intrusion detection dataset is such an example. It contains 18-year-old network traces (with no resemblance to modern networks) and old attacks.

ID2T stands for "Intrusion Detection Dataset Toolkit". It is an open source toolkit designed to inject synthetic, yet highly realistic attacks, into network traces with the PCAP format. ID2T provides a wide range of modern cyber-attacks for injection; from malware and web application attacks (e.g., against Joomla) to SQL injection and DDoS attacks. Injected attacks are made as realistic as possible by replicating the network conditions and characteristics of any inputted network trace. In this demo session we present the first public release of ID2T, which builds on top of our theoretical work [1].

When it comes to mitigating phishing, visibility is half the battle. Knowing what phishing attacks are hitting your organization is key to stopping them. Users can be an incredible source of alerting for phishing emails, but they often don't know where to report the emails. Also, having the ability to collect, correlate, and auto-respond to these reports is key to stopping attacks as quickly they come in. These are problems solved by IsThisLegit for free via open-source, unlike any somewhat similar but cost-prohibitive offerings out there.

IsThisLegit is a Chrome extension and web application dashboard (leveraging Google App Engine) designed to support the management of phishing response for end-users and admins. By rolling out the Chrome extension, users will see a button in Gmail that allows them to easily report phishing emails to their security team with a single click. Now there's no need for users to remember which email address they need to send reports to. The email is then automatically reported and deleted from their inbox.

Once submitted, admins can then use the dashboard to rapidly analyze reported emails, identify phishing trends, categorize phishing emails, and set up auto-response rules.This allows the security team to quickly identify and respond to ongoing attacks.

This demo will be unique for Arsenal because it covers the full lifecycle of phishing mitigation with the 'holy trinity' of tools (all developed by the Duo Labs team). These three distinct open-source tools work together seamlessly to test and train users (Gophish), help protect/take the burden off of users by making it more difficult for attackers (Phinn), and make reporting incidents as easy as a click of the button (IsThisLegit).

### [Introducing varc: Volatile Artifact Collector](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
Varc (https://github.com/cado-security/varc) is a recently-released
open source volatile artifact collection tool.

Driven by a philosophy of simplicity and reliability, the tool was
developed to aid investigation of security incidents, and is available
to the community under a friendly licence. Varc achieves this by
collecting a snapshot of volatile data from a system and outputting it
as JSON - so that it can easily be ingested by another parser or read
by a human investigator.


Varc’s design philosophy has an emphasis on portability, meaning that
it can run across operating systems, in cloud and on-premise
environments – and also supports serverless artifact collection.


And if there is a demo talk requirement:

In this talk, Matt Muir, Threat Intelligence Researcher, Cado Security
and Chris Doman, CTO Cado Security will discuss the motivation for
developing varc. They’ll also cover the technical challenges inherent
to volatile artifact collection in serverless environments and across
operating systems. Finally, they’ll give a live demonstration of varc
and show the audience how it can be used to aid incident response.


Description
The talk will be divided into the following 4 sections:
1) Background and Motivation
2) Technical Challenges
3) varc Demonstration
4) Conclusion


Background and Motivation
Matt and Chris will begin the talk with some discussion of what
exactly varc is and an overview of its features. They’ll then move
on to discuss the reason for Cado Security’s development of this tool
and what problems varc addresses, when compared with other volatile
collection tools. Some background to varc’s design philosophy will
also be provided.


Technical Challenges
In this section, Matt and Chris will discuss the various technical
challenges that working with volatile data presents. This will include
an overview of which artifacts were deemed important to an incident
responder and how these can be accessed via Python code on the various
operating systems varc supports. There will also be some discussion on
how varc operates in serverless environments and what this means for
investigators working in this area.

varc Demonstration
This section will include a demonstration of varc on a system where
some malicious activity has occurred. Matt and Chris will highlight
artifacts of interest and demonstrate varc’s extraction and
presentation of these to the audience.


Conclusion
The talk will conclude with discussion about how varc is integrated
into Cado and how this benefits users of the platform. Matt and Chris
will also discuss the potential for further work in this area and
provide the audience with details of how they can get involved.

### [IoT Hunter: A Framework Tool for Building IoT Threat Intelligence System](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
Tencent IoT Hunter is a framework tool created to quickly build the IoT threat intelligence platform, which is more specifically designed to analyze IOT threats. The tool contains all important modules for IOT threat analysis, including information collection, data extraction, threat data analysis, and intelligence visualization. Intelligence data includes, but is not limited to, static information extraction, dynamic operation information extraction, and third-party network platform information. The goal of this tool is to help security researchers quickly and easily build their own IOT intelligence platform for IOT malware research and threat tracking.

Using this framework tool, you can get the malicious information (CNC, Domain, function, etc.) in the IoT sample file very precisely and fine-grained. Compared with the traditional simple string extraction, this extraction method is more accurate and supports the extraction of encrypted information. This malicious information can be directly used to integrate into the IoT malicious information base and threat cloud search services, without the need for analysts to re-confirm, greatly improving the efficiency of malicious information processing.

Traditional intelligence information extraction tools are often used to extract predefined information. The framework provides a good extension interface, where users can write personalized plugins to expand the scope of information extraction. For the emerging threats, security analysts can quickly integrate analysis experience such as decryption algorithm into the framework, accurately extract malicious intelligence, and reduce invalid redundant information.

In the tool demonstration phase, we will demonstrate how to use the entire tool. Including the static information of IOT samples. Take popular IOT threats as examples to show how to precisely extract CNC, weak passwords, and configuration files. We will also show how to develop and integrate the platform plug-ins to extract any specific intelligence information of concern. All of the above data information is imported to the platform, security personnel can be free to carry out data analysis, malware track, threat visualization.


### [IoT-Home-Guard: A Tool for Malicious Behavior Detection in IoT Devices](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
IoT devices, especially secondhand devices and rental devices, are under threat of malware implant attack with physical access. Once IoT devices are compromised, hackers can turn them into snooping devices. From a defensive perspective, there are no solutions to detect Trojans in IoT devices.

We present IoT-Home-Guard, a hardware device to detect malicious behaviors of Trojans in IoT devices, such as audios/videos snoop and remote control. It consists of four parts: data flow catcher, traffic analyzing engine, device fingerprint database and a web server. Features of network traffic are extracted by traffic analyzing engine and compared with pre-built device fingerprint database to detect malicious behaviors.

In another research, we were able to implant Trojans in eight devices including smart speakers, ip cameras, routers, driving recorders and mobile translators. We collected characteristics of those devices and ran IoT-Home-Guard. All devices implanted Trojans have been detected. We believe that malicious behaviors of more devices can be identified with high accuracy after supplement of fingerprint database.

The first generation IoT-Home-Guard tool is a hardware device based on Raspberry Pi with wireless network interface controllers. We will customize new hardware in the second generation. Software part is available in our Github (https://github.com/arthastang/IoT-Home-Guard). The system can be set up with software part in laptops after essential environment configuration.

We present IoT-Implant-Toolkit, a framework for Trojans implantation research of IoT devices. It is a toolkit consisting of essential software tools on firmware modification, serial port debugging, software analysis and stable spy clients. We wrapped tools we proved useable in the framework and provided a universal call interface. Additionally, we packed useful open-source tools we developed into the framework. Each software tool acts as a plugin which can be easily added into the framework. With an easy-to-use and extensible shell-like environment, IoT-Implant-Toolkit is a one-stop-shop toolkit simplifying complex procedure of IoT malware implantation.

With IoT-Implant-Toolkit, we were able to implant Trojans in eight devices with physical access, including smart speakers, cameras, driving recorders and mobile translators. We turned them into snooping devices, which send audios or videos in real time. Our presentation will also include live demos of those implanted devices.

![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
Joern is an award-winning open-source platform for robust query-based analysis of C/C++. It enables mining large code bases for vulnerabilities using a Scala-based domain-specific query language and provides the reference implementation for code property graphs. With its fuzzy parsing approach, it is specifically suited for machine learning applications. Joern serves as the fundament for the commercial SAST and code exploration products at ShiftLeft.

The Code Property Graph (CPG) is an intermediate code representation designed for code querying. The core idea it promotes is to merge multiple different program representations into a joint graph data structure and allowing queries to be formulated as graph traversals. In its initial form as presented in 2014, the CPG makes available syntactical information, control flow information and data flow for C/C++ programs. It was later further generalized to host multiple different programming languages, and higher-level code representations.

KICS stands for Keeping Infrastructure as Code Secure. It is open source and is a must-have for any cloud native project to find security vulnerabilities, compliance issues, and infrastructure misconfigurations early in the development cycle of the underlying infrastructure-as-code (IaC).

KICS supports about 20 different technologies including Terraform, Cloudformation, Kubernetes, Docker, over several cloud providers like AWS, Microsoft Azure or Google Cloud. It is the only open-source project that has achieved any Center for Internet Security (CIS) certification.

KICS is fully customizable and extensible by the addition of rules for new vulnerabilities. It is available as a Docker image, and is paired in multiple platforms to leverage its integration on the development life-cycle and the DevSecOps mentality of its users. Gitlab has chosen KICS as its default IaC scanner; it is also available in ArgoHub, as a hook in TerraformCloud or as a Github Action for Github workflows.

One of the most recent features of KICS is auto remediation. With this feature KICS goes full cycle in preventing vulnerable code from going into production by scanning the code, exposing the issues, and automatically remediating them. Such a feature is both available from the CLI interface, or via a plugin for the Visual Studio Code editor, where we bring together auto-remediation and real-time scanning. As the developer writes IaC scripts, KICS automatically looks for vulnerabilities, proposes fixes and remediates them. By the time the IaC scripts are finished, developers are rest assured that it is safe to go into production. This is shift-left security brought to its splendor.

### [KUBEBOT - SCALEABLE AND AUTOMATED TESTING SLACKBOT WITH THE BACKEND RUNNING ON KUBERNETES](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
Security Testing, or for that matter any sort of testing, is still being done in ways that are not really scalable and extensible. Testers like to write their own tools/scripts and run them locally on their system. There are many problems that plague this kind of approach for testing.

We will be discussing some of these problems and releasing a new tool - KubeBot - that was primarily built for automating and scaling bug bounties i.e. something that would run multiple tools on a schedule against multiple targets and only returns back the output from these tools if the output changes.

However, over time, it has proven out to be a more generic framework that can be leveraged as a harness to run any security testing tool and is easily scaleable (because of Kubernetes in the backend). It is extensible and provides a nice front end in the form of a Slackbot so that you can look at the results on a real-time basis.

### [Kinstrument: Binary-Only Instrumentation Framework for Linux Kernel Based on Breakpoint](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
For regular Linux kernels, we can use qemu or vmware, and then use gdb to debug the kernel, but for some special embedded devices, such as Android phones, it is difficult to debug and instrument the kernel. In order to debug the kernel, it often needs to recompile the kernel and use additional hardware.

The characteristics of kinstrument are as follows:

1. The kernel only needs to support the insertion of the ko module, the kernel does not need to be recompiled, and no additional hardware is required.
2. Support instrumentation basic blocks, and get basic block coverage of kernel code
3. Use the breakpoint mechanism to hook and debug arbitrary instructions.


Kinstrument can be used for kernel debugging and Fuzz.

### [Kung Fu Malware](#)  
![BH-US-16](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-US-16-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
Focusing on Windows operating systems, we've developed an agent to try to activate some techniques that malware usually include to avoid being detected by a sandbox or malware analyst, emulating malware analysis computer inside a common PC. This agent would add a new layer of protection without interacting with the malware, because current malware will not run their malicious payload in a sandbox or while being debbuged. As we know the different malware families implement anti-reversing, anti-debuging and anti-virtualization characteristics along with other techniques such as to detect well known process and windows. Malware writers implement these techniques to prevent the execution of malicious code within a laboratory that could help researchers in their analysis and eradication.Some of those are:Detecting when a program is being debugged.Detecting when a program is running in a virtual machine, by reading some registry keys or locating some files or processes used by the virtualization technology.The detection programs used by malware analysts such as wireshark, IDA or process explorer.The proliferation of those techniques and strategies has brought us to a new solution; pretend the behavior of a malware analysis device and / or sandbox, by using some of the techniques explained above, in order to prevent the execution of the malicious code.

### [LOG-MD](#)  
![BH-US-16](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-US-16-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
LOG-MD is designed for Windows based systems to audit log and advanced audit policy settings and guide users to enable and configure the audit settings based on industry audit standards like CIS, USGCB, AU ACSC and the 'Windows Logging Cheat Sheets' to help push and encourage moving security and detection of audit logging forward. LOG-MD was also designed to gather the artifacts from malicious activity, referred to as "Malicious Discovery", more easily than the standard methods many professionals use today. LOG-MD is designed to speed up the investigation of a suspect system, or help validate it is good, and to speed up evaluating malware in a lab environment.Malicious Discovery is a challenge for many and the Mean Time to Detection (MTTD) from a compromise or worse yet, a breach is still close to a year for most companies. LOG-MD is designed to help small, medium, large, and enterprise businesses improve their Malicious Discovery with a tool that can be run manually or distributed across the environment.LOG-MD replaces or augments several security and forensic tools that have not been updated in years, combing many features professionals rely on, into one easy to use tool. LOG-MD audits the system at each run for audit log related settings, and harvests security related log events. LOG-MD performs hashes of the full filesystem and compares it to a baseline or Master-Digest of trusted files to reduce files that need to be investigated. LOG-MD performs a full baseline of the registry and compares it to a trusted baseline, and searches for special artifacts like the null byte character used in registry keys to hide malware artifacts and large registry keys where malware hides. LOG-MD also harvests PowerShell activity and can harvest optional Sysmon and Windows Logging Service (WLS) events as well for more detailed analysis of system activity. LOG-MD utilizes whitelists to filter down the results of known good and trusted results to make Malicious Discovery easier and faster. In addition LOG-MD can take the artifact details of IP addresses and perform a WhoIs lookup to gain ownership and country information and run files and IP's through VirusTotal for artifact evaluation. Additionally, special artifacts hunting and reporting are being added to LOG-MD as malware authors create them, what we refer to as Malware Management, which is what LOG-MD is based on.


### [LOGFEEDER](#)  
![BH-EU-17](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-EU-17-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
LogFeeder enables the injection of SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) application logs from Google Apps, Duo, Salesforce, Workday and many more into an ELK (Elasticsearch-Logstash-Kibana) cluster for monitoring and alerting. It is also possible to get the logs through AWS SQS Queue integration, which allows more flexibility to manipulate where the logs eventually end up. The automated approach saves security teams a lot of time by collating all the information vis-a-vis individually combing through separate data sources for each service. In addition to this, LogFeeder makes it possible to utilize awesome alerting tools, like ElastAlert (presented at Black Hat USA Arsenal in 2015), for robust alerting in response to suspicious actions. At Yelp, we use LogFeeder as a tool to ingest most of our 3rd party service providers' audit logs into a central SIEM (Security Information and Event Monitoring) system. Paired up with ElastAlert, it is the core of our monitoring and alerting pipeline.


### [LaiFu: A Modern Protocol Fuzzing Framework Based on Scapy](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
As a protocol tester, we often use scapy to interact with the protocol because it is able to craft or decode packets easily and it implements a wide number of protocols. However, the fuzz function supported by scapy can not fuzz protocols sufficiently and effectively. Testers often need to write additional fuzzing code based on other fuzzing frameworks such as Peach and Boofuzz.

According to the current situation, we design a protocol fuzzing tool named "LaiFu". LaiFu framework allows testers to use scapy to specify protocol formats directly. We designed the corresponding mutation algorithm according to the various field types of scapy's packet. Meanwhile, we also provide a tool to show the coverage of fuzzing target in real time. Testers only need to put each data packet as a node into the graph and then start the fuzzing test. Another advantage is that LaiFu makes many protocols already implemented by scapy to be fuzzable.

We are going to open source this tool to assist testers or developers to test their code and make protocol fuzzing easy and effective.

### [Limon - Sandbox for Analyzing Linux Malwares](#)  
![BH-ASIA-16](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ASIA-16-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
Limon is a sandbox for automating Linux malware analysis. It collects, analyzes, and reports on the run time indicators of Linux malware. It allows one to inspect the Linux malware before execution, during execution, and after execution (post-mortem analysis) by performing static, dynamic and memory analysis using open source tools. Limon analyzes the malware in a controlled environment, monitors its activities and its child processes to determine the nature and purpose of the malware. It determines the malware's process activity, interaction with the file system, network, it also performs memory analysis and stores the analyzed artifacts for later analysis.For more information, please visit this blog post on Limon: http://malware-unplugged.blogspot.in/2015/11/limon-sandbox-for-analyzing-linux.html; the download link is also available on GitHub: https://github.com/monnappa22/Limon.

![BH-US-15](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-US-15-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
Have you ever wanted to inject code into a Linux process, but found yourself lacking an easy way to do it? Ever wished Linux had a system call, like CreateRemoteThread on Windows? Linux-Inject is the tool you were wishing for! It can load a shared object inside another process, in much the same way Windows lets you load DLLs in other processes. It does this by attaching to the target process with ptrace and overwriting part of its address space with a custom loader. Once the target process has executed the loader, Linux-Inject restores the target's overwritten memory and register state and sends it on its merry way. At that point, it's up to you to wreak whatever havoc you'd like within the target process via the newly loaded shared object. Linux-Inject supports x86, x86_64, and ARM.


### [LoRaWAN Auditing Framework](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
IoT deployments continue to grow, and one part of that significant growth is composed of millions of LPWAN (low-power wide-area network) sensors deployed in hundreds of cities (Smart Cities) around the world, also in industries and homes. One of the most used LPWAN technologies is LoRa for which LoRaWAN is the network standard (MAC layer). LoRaWAN is a secure protocol with built in encryption, but implementation issues and weaknesses affect the security of most current deployments.

This project intends to provide a series of tools to craft, parse, send, analyze and crack a set of LoRaWAN packets in order to audit or pentest the security of a LoraWAN infrastructure.


### [LogonTracer](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
LogonTracer is a tool to investigate malicious logon by visualizing and analyzing Windows Active Directory event logs. Event log analysis is a key element in DFIR. In the lateral movement phase of APT incidents, analysis Windows Active Directory event logs is crucial since it is one of the few ways to identify compromised hosts. At the same time, examining the logs is usually a painful task because Windows Event Viewer is not a best tool. Analysts often end up exporting entire logs into text format, then feeding them to other tools such as SIEM. However, SIEM is neither a perfect solution to handle the increasing amount of logs.

We would like to introduce a more specialized event log analysis tool for incident responders. It visualizes event logs using network analysis and machine learning so as to show the correlation of accounts and hosts. Proven with our on the ground response experience, most importantly it is an open source tool.


### [Lucky CAT: A Distributed Fuzzing Management Framework](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
Lucky CAT (Crash All the Things!) is a distributed fuzzing framework with an easy to use web interface. It allows management of fuzzing jobs on several remote machines concurrently. Lucky CAT aims to be easily usable, scaleable, extensible, and fun. To achieve this, it is built using several micro services and it relies on many open source projects. Furthermore, it offers a RESTful API to automate it or to integrate it with other tools.

Lucky CAT comes with several plugins for mutation engines (e.g. /dev/urandom, radamsa), fuzzers (afl, qemu_fuzzer, a minimalistic file fuzzer) and verifiers (local gdb exploitable, remote gdb exploitable). There are templates (in Python and C) that allow to quickly integrate, for example, new fuzzers and verifiers. Fuzzers can rely on their own mutation engine (e.g. afl) but Lucky CAT can also generate test cases for a fuzzer. This is handy when writing a fuzzer for an embedded device with limited computational resources or a small one-shot fuzzer for a custom protocol.

Its origin is the Nightmare Fuzzing Project. However, Lucky CAT goes beyond its ancestor. It is more 2018-ish using latest technologies such as RabbitMQ, Flask, MongoDB, and Python3. Lucky CAT's main objective is to automate the fuzzing process as far as possible so as to security researchers can focus on what they can best: identifying attack surfaces or writing custom fuzzers.
Therefore, future releases will focus on, amongst others, automatic deployment of fuzzers, crash notification and job summaries via email and instant messaging, and kernel core dump analysis.

Lynis is a nifty tool to perform in-depth security tests. It checks your systems for configuration errors, software vulnerabilities, or other weaknesses. Running on the system itself, it can uncover flaws not seen by other tools (e.g. vulnerability scanners). After finishing the scan, it will present the user with a report of the findings. Suggestions are made to enhance your security posture or help you remain compliant with security standards like PCI DSS.

Lynis is written in shell script and runs on systems like Linux, macOS, and UNIX-based derivatives. The tool is ideal for those who seek to perform vulnerability assessments and penetration tests, or having to apply system hardening measures.


### [MI-X (Am I Exploitable?).](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
‘Am I Exploitable?’, is an open source tool aimed at effectively determining whether a local host or a running container image is truly vulnerable to a specific vulnerability by accounting for all factors which affect *actual* exploitability. The tool prints the logical steps it takes in order to reach a decision and can generate a flow chart depicting the complete logical flow.

The first critical step to address any security vulnerability is to verify whether or not your environment is affected. Even if a vulnerable package is installed on your system, this condition alone does not determine exploitability as several conditions must be in place in order for the vulnerability to be applicable (exploitable). For example, can the vulnerability only be exploited under a specific configuration or in a specific OS?.

Most conventional vulnerability scanners rely on package manager metadata in order to determine the installed components (and in which versions) and then cross reference this data with vulnerability advisories in order to determine what vulnerabilities affect the system. The problem with that is that often software may be deployed without a package manager. For example, software might be built from source and then added to an image or unzipped from a tarball to a specific location on the file system. In these cases, no package manager data is associated with the application, which can result in false negatives (a scanner will “miss” these vulnerabilities) and offer a false sense of security.

We aim to build a community of researchers that can improve the validation process of historically dangerous vulnerabilities, as well as newly discovered ones, so users and organizations will understand whether they are vulnerable or not, as well as which validation flow is used to reach that verdict, and what steps are necessary for remediation or mitigation.

![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
Mini programs are lightweight apps that run inside another app. They don't need to be downloaded or upgraded through app stores. They make it possible for one app to perform the service of many apps add up and have over one billion users in China, which brings new mobile security challenges. Hackers can bypass the security defenses of Mini programs in various ways(like string truncation, whitelist bypass, malformed label). A successful exploit of bypassing may lead to arbitrary code execution or leak of sensitive data.

Security workers are struggling to discover and fix vulnerabilities in the workflow of the mini program. It results in a greater need for automated mini-program fuzz testing tools.

We will introduce the MPFuzzer, the first fuzz testing tool which finds vulnerabilities in mini program technology stacks automatically by trying different strategies.

MPFuzzer can fuzz any mini program platform in the field by configuring a simple config file without writing any code. The key inside our work is to quickly generate large numbers of mini program code and mutate them to test as many mini program technology stacks as possible.

As a practical impact, our tool has detected more than ten mini program critical vulnerabilities.

Manufacturer Usage Description (MUD) is a recently introduced IETF standard designed to protect IoT devices and networks by isolating IoT device based on the information that define the behavior of that device. The standard defines a straight-forward method to implement a defensive mechanism based on the rules that are introduced by manufacturer of the device. MUD-Files are the core component of the MUD standard and contain the access control information of IoT devices. However, MUD-Files may contain possibly hundreds of access control rules. As a result, reading and validating these files is a challenge; and determining how multiple IoT devices interact is difficult for the developer and infeasible for the consumer. MUD-Visualizer is a tool that provides a visualization of any number of MUD-Files and is designed to enable developers to produce correct MUD-Files by providing format corrections, integrating them with other MUD-Files, and identifying conflicts through visualization. MUD-Visualizer is scalable and its core task is to merge and illustrate ACEs for multiple devices; both within and beyond the local area network.

![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
"MalConfScan with Cuckoo" is a tool for automatically extracting known malware configuration data. With the growing number of malware variants emerging day by day, the automation of malware analysis using sandbox systems is becoming popular. Such systems have a function to list malware behavior on Windows OS, such as communication, file and registry creation. On the other hand, malware analysts spend more time extracting malware configuration data rather than analyzing malware behavior. There are two reasons for it:

1. Many malware variants mostly share the same code except for configuration data. In other words, a type of malware and configuration data are the only elements that need to be checked.

2. Malware configuration data contains an attack campaign ID and communication encryption keys. This information would be the critical data for investigating logs in incident response, and also for knowing the actor's target.

We present a malware analysis tool to extract configuration data for incident responders and malware analysts. This tool automates analysis for many types of malware based on our long-time research and, reduce the time spent on malware analysis. In addition, this tool can be used not only for malware analysis but also for memory forensics. It can help a victim organization with malware infection to identify C2 server information and encryption key which are necessary for their incident response.

### [Maltese (Malware Traffic Emulating Software)](#)  
![BH-US-16](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-US-16-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
In most cases, malware communicates with a Command and Control (C&C) server in order to download updates or additional modules, receive commands, exfiltrate data, etc. The DNS system plays an important role in C&C communication: In order to hide their C&C servers from detection, common modern malware families employ Domain-Generation Algorithms (DGA) rather than hard-coded addresses to find their C&C servers. Furthermore, some malware families provide a back-channel and exfiltrate data in specially crafted DNS requests, thereby abusing the fact that DNS traffic is often not firewalled.Due to the importance of the DNS in malware's C&C communication, recent malware detection systems try to detect malware based on anomalies in DNS request patterns. As one would expect, the suppliers of such detection systems claim that their solutions work as a catch-all for any malware that abuses the DNS system as part of its operation. But, prior to deploying any malware detector, one needs to test these claims by evaluating the effectiveness of the detector. Also, when a new malware variant is detected in the wild, it is important for security teams to verify that their deployed solutions can detect them.One way of accomplishing the above tasks is to execute real malware samples and observe the results of the detector. However, this is infeasible in a production network, as there is always a risk of the malware causing damage. Furthermore, malware samples often do not execute on demand, and therefore testing may be difficult. In our contribution, we describe a tool and a framework for evaluating the effectiveness of DNS-based malware detectors using emulation. We propose the following approach: We emulate the DNS traffic patterns of a given malware family, inject it into a network, and observe whether the malware detector reports an infection. The injected traffic is completely benign and, therefore, testing poses no risk to the network. The generation of DNS traffic patterns is based on information published by various members of the security community. From malware analysis, typically, one or more of the following artifacts may be found for a given malware â a list of domains generated, a network packet capture (PCAP) of the malicious traffic, or a Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA) that is published by another researcher.Our tool enables security professionals to utilize any of these three artifacts in an easy, quick, and configurable manner for generating DNS traffic patterns. The tool is implemented in Python and will be made available free of charge, and we are also exploring an open source license. Our presentation will demo an evaluation infrastructure, and discuss use cases in order to help the audience gain more confidence in their security deployments. The tool is built using a plugin-based architecture, and we will also discuss ways in which the audience may contribute new plugins to the tool.

### [MemTracer: Hunting for Forensic Artifacts in Memory](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
MemTracer is a tool that offers live memory analysis capabilities, allowing digital forensic practitioners to discover and investigate stealthy attack traces hidden in memory.
Advanced persistence threat (APT) adversaries use stealthy attack tactics that only leave volatile short-lived memory evidence. The reflective Dynamic-Link Library (DLL) load technique is considered one of the stealthiest attack techniques. Reflective DLL load allows adversaries to load malicious code directly into memory, rather than loading a file from the disk. Thus, reflective
DLL load leaves no digital evidence present on the disk. The malicious DLL continues to execute as long as the compromised process is running. Terminating a compromised process leads to the removal of the malicious DLL from memory, and the release of the memory region back to the pool for reallocation. Therefore, memory needs to be examined periodically in order to detect the existence of a malicious DLL that loaded reflectively into memory.
Loading DLL reflectively produces an unusual memory region's characteristics that can indicate its existence. The MemTracer tool was developed to efficiently scan memory regions to detect reflective DLL loading symptoms. Mainly, MemTracer aims to detect native .NET framework DLLs that are loaded reflectively. Additionally, MemTracer provides the ability to search for a specific loaded DLL by name, which can retrieve the list of processes that have abnormally loaded the specified module for further investigation.


### [Memhunter: A Live Alternative to Volatility Memory Forensic Plugins](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
Memhunter automates the hunting of memory resident malware, improving the threat hunter analysis process and remediation times. The tool detects and reports memory-resident malware living on endpoint processes. Memhunter only works on Windows at the moment, and it detects known malicious memory injection techniques. The detection process is performed through live analysis and without needing memory dumps. The tool was designed as a replacement of memory forensic volatility plugins such as malfind and hollowfind. The idea of not requiring memory dumps helps on performing the memory resident malware threat hunting at scale, without manual analysis, and without the complex infrastructure needed to move dumps to forensic environments.

In order to find footprints left by malware code injection techniques, memhunter relies on a set of memory inspection heuristics and ETW trace collection. Once a suspicious process gets identified, the tool filters out false-positives through Yara Rules analysis and VirusTotal queries. This down-selection process helps the tool to reduce the number of false positives, leaving only known-bad processes. The tool then gets forensic information on the remaining set of suspicious findings and report them back to the analyst for remediation steps.

The tool itself is a self-contained binary which can be run on the endpoint to conduct the memory hunting. The idea of a self-contained binary helps on reducing the footprint, the dependencies needed, and improving the deployability of the tool. The binary contains a set of embedded "hunters" plugins, each one in charge of performing a specific heuristic detection. It also contains the ability to register the binary as an ETW collection service, which will augment the findings of next runs by providing contextual information on the attack. The down-selection is performed through libyara and VirusTotal client functionality.

### [MetaHub: Automating Ownership, Context and Impact Assessments in Security Findings](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
Security findings from automated sources such as CSPMs, software vulnerability scanners, or compliance scanners often overwhelm security teams with excessive, generic, context-less information. You may have heard countless times that context in security is key, so why don't these tools provide you with more of it? Simply put, they were not designed to do so.

This shortcoming means that determining ownership and impact can be time-consuming, leading to critical vulnerabilities going unnoticed, and causing unnecessary noise or friction between security teams and other departments.

My proposed demo introduces MetaHub, a tool designed to address these issues by automating the three essential stages of security finding assessment: owner determination, contextualization, and impact definition. Leveraging metadata through MetaChecks, MetaTags, MetaTrails, and MetaAccount, MetaHub provides a detailed, context-aware assessment of each finding.

By integrating MetaHub, teams can significantly reduce false positives, streamline the detection and resolution of security findings, and strategically tailor their scanner selection to minimize unnecessary noise. The ability to concentrate on meaningful, high-impact issues will be the primary focus of the demo.

MetaHub relies on the ASFF format for ingesting security findings and can consume data from AWS Security Hub or any ASFF-supported scanner like Prowler, ElectricEye, or Inspector. This compatibility means you can continue using the scanners you already rely on but add what's missing to those findings: Ownership, Context, and Impact.

MetaHub also generates powerful visual reports and is designed for use as a CLI tool or within automated workflows, such as AWS Security Hub custom actions or AWS Lambda functions.

The automation of context, ownership, and impact is not commonly addressed by open-source tools; MetaHub introduces a solution to this problem that aims to be agnostic to the source scanner.

MetasploitHelper was developed to assist penetration testers in internal engagements. There are a large number of exploits and modules that are available to penetration testers to use. However, it is often difficult and challenging for penetration testers to keep up to date with the latest exploits.MetasploitHelper tends to make things easier for testers by testing and matching Metasploit modules against open ports and URI paths on the target hosts.What's New!Better detection and matching for web application exploits in MetasploitExploit-DB is a very popular source of working exploits. Currently, there are more than 21,298 web application exploits available.The number of exploits for web applications are increasing at a very fast rate due to more applications being developed and used.We have added a parser for the web application exploits in Exploit-DB and added them to metasploitHelper and now you can scan and detect more exploitable vulnerabilities much easier.

Metasploit is widely used by penetration-testers during pen-test. They contain a lot of useful exploits that can be used during penetration tests. However, it is a painful task to search for related exploits after running a Nmap scan. It is possible that we could forget to use a potential exploit that could get us a shell on the remote system. There are two main types of exploits in Metasploit that we need to consider: Metasploit modules that target URI and modules that target specific ports. I developed MetasploitHelper so that we can bridge Nmap and Metasploit modules. This tool is meant to save a lot of time looking up exploits during penetration tests.

![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
The mitigations for Spectre highlighted a weak link in the patching process for many users: firmware (un)availability. While updated microcode was made publicly available for many processors, end-users are unable to directly consume it. Instead, platform and operating system vendors need to distribute firmware and kernel patches which include the new microcode. Inconsistent support from those vendors has left millions of users without a way to consume these critical security updates, until now. Micro-Renovator provides the ability to apply microcode updates without modifying either platform firmware or the operating system, through simple (and reversible) modifications to the EFI boot partition.

Using threat intelligence to enforce security policy poses several challenges. Sources of threat indicators often place indicators in multiple formats or format them inconsistently. Using indicators from multiple sources and packaging them into different formats requires a large investment of time and effort, especially as you discover new sources of indicators. It is also difficult to keep track of updates to threat indicator sources, since they are updated at different times and not always on a regular basis. To automate many of these manual processes, we have released MineMeld.MineMeld is an open source Threat Intelligence framework you can use, among other things, to process indicators and automatically enforce policy on your firewall or augment logs in your SIEM. At the core of MineMeld is a flexible and extensible engine where the data flow is described via a graph of nodes exchanging indicators with a protocol inspired by BGP. By changing the nodes and how they are connected, you can easily define any kind of Threat Intelligence processing logic. And if you need support for a new format, a new protocol or a new logic, you can develop & add your own custom node to the graph.

Mobexler is a mobile pentest VM that include a wide variety of tools to help in Android and iOS pentesting. It includes tools for both static and dynamic analysis of applications. It allows pentesters to use a single VM to pentest both Android and iOS applications. With the host OS as elementary it also provides an awesome UI experience and allow for intuitive usage of tools just like you would on a host install. External devices can be connected via USB and can be used to install and test application.

Why we made Mobexler ?

We made Mobexler because there was no such platforms out there which was up to date with the latest pentest tools for both static and dynamic testing which included tools like frida and objection and can be used for both android and ios pentesting. Mobexler was built keeping in mind that any user can just download the VM and begins testing for both platforms without going through the trouble of installation and configuration of all the different tools required.

Future work includes:

![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
There are many protections being applied to mobile applications nowadays, and most penetration testing engineer use primitive methods to crack them. Therefore, if we can modify the data or insert the payload of the vulnerability before the protection is processed, all the protections will be transparent to the penetration testers and there will be no concern about their implementation, making app API testing purer.

### [Mole: Out-of-Band Exploitation Framework](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
Mole is a new open source framework for identifying and exploiting out-of-band (OOB) application vulnerabilities in applications. Mole provides an all-in-one payload generation framework and callback/payload server that streamlines the OOB payload creation and exploitation process

Mole takes inspiration from tools such as BurpSuite's Collaborator, XSS Hunter, but improves upon them in several key ways. Mole decouples the monitoring and payload generation from the testing tooling allowing for the 24x7 monitoring of OOB interaction. With this release, Mole supports the tracking of both DNS and HTTP/HTTPS interaction for all supported payload types which include XSS, XXE, PDF, and OOXML. These payloads can be generated and saved to a directory for manual testing, dynamically inserted into requests with Mole's Burp Suite Extension, or retrieved via API for custom integrations.

Mole tracks OOB interaction with customizable tracking tokens, which are stored on the callback server. When a valid token is presented to the callback server, either a pre-defined notification is sent, a custom web hook is invoked, or a payload server is invoked. The tracking token length and character set can be customized to work around exploitation constraints. During payload creation, context can be added to each tracking token through the tags feature. These tags are returned in any notifications and webhooks to easily identify which payload fired and in what context.

Mole's plugin framework allows it to be easily extended by creating custom payloads and payload servers. Plugins can specify both payload creation and server-side payload actions such as dynamically serving DTDs for an XXE payload.

### [NAD - A Tool for Performing Dynamic Runtime Analysis of Android Functions](#)  
![BH-ASIA-17](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ASIA-17-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
Android application penetration testing goes further than testing the client to server communication. In order to get a holistic view on the risk exposure, a thorough analysis of the application has to be done to understand how the application works. This is also imperative to be able to bypass jailbreak detection, SSL pinning, or figure out how the application is handling encryption (e.g. being able to decrypt certain values).There are several approaches available:The application can be decompiled, modified and recompiled. This approach however may not always work due to errors while decompiling.Patch the application by utilizing method hooks and overriding the original method. In order to identify the correct code and method to patch, the penetration tester has to go through the very time consuming process of figuring out the correct methods.Adding to the frustration, most applications in release mode produce minified and obfuscated code. The above-mentioned problems makes analyzing an Android application a very tedious process, even before the actual analysis of the application has started. Currently there are no tools available for Android that allow for easy method hooking. This is why I started developing NAD, a tool which allows testers to perform on the fly method hooks.This talk aims to demonstrate an Android tool built upon the Xposed framework. This tool is an attempt to be the "Burp suite" for Android application methods. It provides the user with several abilities to ease such frustration and make life easier:Perform trace method callsIntercept all methods of the Android applicationPause the applicationModify the input parameters of the hooked methodModify the return value of the hooked methodMy goal for developing this tool is to save time and provide more insight into compiled Android applications.DOWNLOAD: https://github.com/HanLee/Not-a-debugger

![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
Imagine… You realize that a malicious threat actor has compromised your network and is currently going through your confidential information. Faced with this dreadful scenario, you initiate an Incident Response.

We have built an agentless open source Incident Response framework based on PowerShell, called "No Agent Hunting" (NOAH), to help security investigation responders to gather a vast number of key artifacts without installing any agent on the endpoints saving precious time.

Our goal is to provide a community-driven scalable platform allowing Incident Response teams across the world to efficiently hunt from the get-go of an incident without having the need to develop ad hoc tools or waste time installing an agent on every endpoint when the incident occurs. We aim to present complex artifact data in an understandable format allowing investigators to respond as quickly as possible.

At a time when the malicious threat actors could have breached your network in multiple ways and left backdoors in the most inconspicuous locations, how fast would you want him found when every second counts?


### [NOPE PROXY (NON-HTTP PROXY EXTENSION)](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
This burp extension adds two new features to BurpSuite.

A Non-HTTP MiTM Intercepting proxy - this extension allows you to create multiple listening ports that can MiTM server side services. It also uses Burp's CA cert so that if the browser or mobile device is already configured to access SSL/TLS requests using this cert then the encrypted binary protocols will be able to connect without generating errors too. It also provides the ability to automatically match and replace hex or strings as they pass through the proxy or you can use custom python code to manipulate the traffic.


A configurable DNS server - this will route all DNS requests to Burp or preconfigured hosts. It makes it easier to send mobile or thick client traffic to Burp. You need to create invisible proxy listeners in BurpSuite for the Burp to intercept HTTP traffic or you can use the second feature of this extension to intercept binary/non-http protocols.

![BH-EU-16](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-EU-16-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
Assessing the security of an iOS application typically requires a plethora of tools, each developed for a specific need and all with different modes of operation and syntax. The Android ecosystem has tools like "drozer" that have solved this problem and aim to be a "one stop shop" for the majority of use cases, however iOS does not have an equivalent. "Needle" is an open source modular framework which aims to streamline the entire process of conducting security assessments of iOS applications, and acts as a central point from which to do so. Given its modular approach, Needle is easily extensible and new modules can be added in the form of python scripts.

Needle is intended to be useful not only for security professionals, but also for developers looking to secure their code. A few examples of testing areas covered by Needle include: data storage, inter-process communication, network communications, static code analysis, hooking and binary protections.â€' The only requirement in order to run Needle effectively is a jailbroken device. The tool's architecture, capabilities and roadmap will be described. A demonstration will also be performed of how Needle can be used to find vulnerabilities in iOS applications from both a black-box and white-box perspective (if source code is provided).

### [NetNeedle](#)  
![BH-US-16](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-US-16-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
We believe that hiding a needle in a haystack is easier if the needle looks like hay. NetNeedle provides encrypted control channels and chat sessions that are disguised to look like other common network activity. It only transmits "decoy" data in the  "payload " section of any packet, so forensic analysts will only see packets that look identical to ordinary ping or HTTP GET requests. The actual data is encoded in IP headers in fields that typically contain random values. This tool was originally written to demonstrate network based steganography principals. However, it is usable in real world circumstances, and can assist in penetration testing within restricted network environments.In addition to evasion features, penetration testers can use NetNeedle to maintain control over servers in environments with highly restrictive access lists. Because this tool subverts expectations surrounding network traffic, it enables users to set up back doors that use simple ICMP packets or TCP ports that are already in use. Administrators who believe that their systems are safe due to access control lists based on a "principle of least privilege" or who believe that ICMP ping is harmless will find themselves sadly mistaken.

![BH-ASIA-15](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ASIA-15-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
Nessus is an awesome tool for vulnerability assessment.For vulnerabilities assessments, sometimes it is useful to run Nmap along side with Nessus. Nmap output can be easily manipulated and the data can be used as input for other tools.Most of the time, we are often faced with tight deadlines. Running the same scan using Nmap and then with Nessus could take up a lot of time and generate a large amount of network traffic.What this tool does is parse a NMAP .xml file, extract ports and IP addresses from the file, and automatically launch a Nessus scan using this information (instead of having to scan the whole network and all the ports again). This results in a faster scan.The tool then queries Nessus for job status and automatically saves the report locally when done.The tool also parses the Nessus reports and extracts important findings from the report so that you don't have to read through the whole report (you can but you don't have to).If you are using VMware Fusion/Workstation, you can use the VMrun command to automatically spin up a VM containing Nessus in a headless mode, runs Nessus scan and shuts down the VM when done.

![BH-US-15](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-US-15-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
Noriben is an open-source system monitoring tool that allows for quick and simplified tracking of malware activity. By wrapping its operation around Microsoft SysInternals Process Monitor, Noriben uses a comprehensive set of filters to generate very succinct reports that provide the required indicators to create Indicators of Compromise (IoC) alerts.Requirements:- Windows-based system with SysInternals Procmon.exe- Python 2.7.9 or 3.x.- Optional Python Requests and a VirusTotal public API key for VT lookups- Optional Python lib-yara for automated Yara scanningNoriben takes large volumes of system activity and filters out the background noise of system activity and legitimate operations. By focusing solely on important API calls, for file creation, registry operations, and network connections, Noriben creates a simple and straightforward report that features only the indicators that a security analyst or malware analyst cares about. Along with collecting indicators, Noriben will process all created or modified files through a collection of provided Yara signatures and detail any results. It will also submit any file hash to VirusTotal to collect its virus score.As Noriben runs in the background during live operation, it is also suitable to acquire activity while malware is being actively debugged by an analyst. This allows for the collection of artifacts not found during normal operation in standard sandboxes.Within 60 seconds an analyst can get a good handle on a malware's capability and determine if it's a new variant of a known family or something completely new and requiring reverse engineering. Noriben is currently in sophomore stages of development and is deployed in a number of malware analysis labs, including those run by federal law enforcement agencies and defense contractors, relying on its output simplicity to help analysts create actionable intelligence.

![BH-EU-17](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-EU-17-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
Data exfiltration from a compromised device is usually achieved over the network, via hardware implant, or by manipulating the characteristics of an internal electronic component. Optical covert channels transmit data by modulating visible light in a way that is undetectable to the human eye. Even though hackers and academics have been exploring methods of optical data exfiltration for years, details on the techniques used to capture transmissions are not fully documented and/or require expensive equipment.

OpticSpy consists of two open source hardware modules that provide a low-cost way to explore, evaluate, and experiment with optical covert channels. One is based on an easy-to-build digital receiver, while the other is an analog design that allows fine-tuning for a particular target signal.

![BH-EU-16](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-EU-16-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
OWASP CSRFGuard implements a variant of the synchronizer token pattern to mitigate the risk of CSRF attacks. In order to implement this pattern, CSRFGuard must offer the capability to place the CSRF prevention token within the HTML produced by the protected web application. CSRFGuard 3 provides developers more fine grain control over the injection of the token. Developers can inject the token in their HTML using either dynamic JavaScript DOM manipulation or a JSP tag library. CSRFGuard no longer intercepts and modifies the HttpServletResponse object as was done in previous releases. The currently available token injection strategies are designed to make the integration of CSRFGuard more feasible and scalable within current enterprise web applications. Developers are encouraged to make use of both the JavaScript DOM Manipulation and the JSP tag library strategies for a complete token injection strategy.

The goal of the Distributed Web Honeypot (DWH) Project is to identify emerging attacks against web applications and report them to the community. This may include automated scanning activity, probes, as well as, targeted attacks against specific web sites or applications. The scope of this project has recently been expanded to include deployment of both standard web application honeypots and/or open proxy honeypots. Project participants may choose whether they want to run their honeypot as an open proxy or a stand-alone sensor. During the Black Hat Arsenal Demos, participants will be able to view live attack data within the central console server. We are also seeking participants who would like to join the project and deploy sensors.

![BH-ASIA-17](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ASIA-17-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
OpenSCAP is the only free and open source implementation of the NIST SCAP standard. It has two major use cases:Vulnerability assessment - enables users to automatically scan their machines for vulnerabilities using OVAL CVE feeds coming from the operating system vendors - Red Hat, Canonical, SUSE, ... OpenSCAP can load the CVE feed and examine the machine, virtual machine storage image or container. Any missing patches are reported.Security compliance - allows fully automated evaluation and remediation of machines using SCAP security policies. Instead of looking at vulnerabilities in this use-case we are looking for weaknesses in the configuration. A good source for SCAP security policies is the open source SCAP Security Guide project which we will demo with OpenSCAP. Check out the list of available products and profiles by visiting https://static.open-scap.org/One of the main improvements in the latest 1.2 branch is the ability to scan various resources using similar command-line interface. We will cover scanning bare-metal machines, remote machines over ssh, VMs, VM storage images, containers and container images.SCAP Workbench is a GUI front-end for OpenSCAP. It allows users to customize security policies for their organization by selecting/deselecting rules and choosing different values (e.g.: password min length) for evaluation. The result can be saved in a so-called tailoring file. To demonstrate we will make such a customized policy.

![BH-US-15](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-US-15-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
Indicator of Compromise (IOC) is a piece of information that can be used to search for or identify potentially compromised systems. Forensic investigators can define and share IOC files according to some standards or rules such as OpenIOC and YARA. Currently, many IOCs are available on the Internet, but most of the IOCs cannot be used for memory forensics because they are composed of indicators dependent on disk or live response data.Two years ago, I introduced "volatile IOCs" based on RAM evidence only at SANS DFIR Summit 2013. We can detect malware in memory images using them faster than using disk-based traditional IOCs. Besides, we can define indicators based on not only metadata like file paths but also malware functions such as code injection sign, imported functions, unpacked codes, and so on. However, in order to scan threats using volatile IOCs, we needed to use a closed-source tool based on OpenIOC standard. I could not improve it even if there were some limitations in the tool.That's why I implemented "openioc_scan" as a plugin for Volatility Framework which is an open-source memory forensic tool. In this demonstration, I explain how to use it and details of the implementation. Furthermore, I also show the results of considerations about IOCs to detect unknown malware in RAM by focusing on generic traits of malware.

We've developed a tool gathering attack vectors against web application such as XSS, SQLi, CSRF, etc. First, We prepared a web server as a decoy based on a famous CMS, WordPress, and built Mod Secrity to collect all logs regarding to HTTP requests including POST body data. Generally speaking, a decoy web server needs web access to some degree as to attract users and attackers. We deployed a system named OTAKU-BOT which automatically collects and posts random information about Japanese ANIME and MANGA(cartoon) into the decoy web server. Very characteristic point of this system is that we can find whether Japanese ANIME is likely to be targeted or not by attackers. (or No correlation between them).Furthermore, We developed another web application "WP Portal", which visualizes these attacks in a real-time. This application enable us to monitor attack trend. WP Portal also has a vulnerability scanner for WordPress. You can start the scanner and view vulnerability reports on WP Portal.Dictionary Files for the scanner is created from honeypots and are updating daily. We will demonstrate this bot and the visualization tool. Participants can got attack vectors via WP Portal! Furthermore, our demo will show honeypots, a website, and analysis of attacks against WordPress.

![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
People in IT eco-system are becoming 'favorite' targets because, 1. they remain weakest link and 2. organisation are becoming mature in securing technology. For a security tester, it is a daunting task to set up a phishing campaign, which includes, decide a look-alike domain, buy it, setup a phishing website with infrastructure, design an email and choose target audience, track the open/click/download and build the analytics. All of these activities are time-consuming and demands a certain skill-set.

Phishing Simulation provides one-stop-solution for organisation to understand security awareness posture without actually performing 'live' phishing attack. Phishing Simulation prepares phishing assessment with tailor-made questions specific to organisation, facilitates target users to complete the assessment, provides an intuitive tutorial and builds the analytics on basis of responses and the meta-data collected about user.

Phishing Simulation has 2 modules:
Admin Module: This module will be used by tester to setup and monitor phishing assessments
- On the basis of inputs provided by tester like organisation name, email ID, domain name, tool automatically generates questions with tailor-made data such as look-alike domains using typo-squatting technique, spoofed sender address, look-alike web-site content
- Assessment will comprise of questions having phishing web-site, spear-phishing email, SMiShing, scenario-based question to make it close to real-world phishing attacks
- Tool also provides analytics in form of graphs to represent security awareness posture of organisation by different categories such as department, employee, target-user action

Client Module: This module will be used by target user to complete the assessment and view tutorial
- Every user within a campaign itself will have 10 unique questions to answer, with the mix of positive and negative scenarios
- Passing criteria is to answer every question correct because all it takes is just one click!

Pocsuite is an open-source remote vulnerability testing framework developed by the Knownsec Security Team.Written in Python and supported both validation and exploitation two plugin-invoked modes, Pocsuite could import batch targets from files and test them against multiple exploit-plugins in advance.There are two ways to work with Pocsuite: configuring exploit-required arguments and running in console-based modes; and handling the output from steps in interactive modes. Besides, it could display output in a human-friendly graph providing more useful information for pentesters.Like Metasploit, it is a development kit for pentesters to develop their own exploits. Users could utilize some auxiliary modules packaged in Pocsuite to extend their exploit functions or integrate Pocsuite to develop other vulnerability assessment tools.At last, Pocsuite is also an extremely useful tool to integrate Seebug and ZoomEye APIs in a collaborative way. Vulnerability assessment can be done automatically and effectively by searching targets through ZoomEye and acquiring PoC scripts from Seebug or locally.

### [Purple Knight](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
Business applications on-premises and in the cloud rely on Active Directory (AD) and Azure Active Directory for authentication, making it a critical piece of IT infrastructure. But securing Active Directory is difficult given its constant flux, its sheer number of settings, and the increasingly sophisticated threat landscape. This creates potential exploitable Indicators of Exposure in AD, and if you have or had a bad actor in your AD you will want to understand the Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) which is the evidence an attacker is there. In this session, we will talk about the Purple Knight freeware tool by Semperis which helps organizations understand the security posture of their hybrid Active Directory as it pertains to IOEs and IOCs.

Purple team exercises are probably one of the most useful types of activities that organizations can engage in these days. Key to effective purple teaming is good communication, data collection and knowledge sharing. For us, this has been a bit of a pain point having to try and manually keep track of activities, actions and events. We did find some tools to aid with this, but none of them truly opensource or flexible enough to allow us to do what we wanted to do. So we built PurpleOPS, which is at its core a data collection tool aligned to MITRE ATT&CK and integrated into other fantastic open-source projects such as Atomic Redteam. It is easy to customize with your own internal knowledge base and test cases, plus it's also written in python3 using Flask, so it's super easy to adjust to your needs.

Have you ever wanted to be at two different places at the same time? When I asked myself this question, I actually started developing this solution in my mind. While performing penetration tests, there are often problems caused by security devices that block the "attacking" IP. This really annoyed me, so I wrote a script to supply a solution for this problem. With a large number of IP addresses performing the attacks, better results are guaranteed - especially when attempting attacks to bypass Web Application Firewalls, Brute-Force type attacks and many more.

### [Qiling Framework: From dark to dawn -- Enlightening the analysis of the most mysterious IoT Firmware](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
With household appliances and wearable gadgets integrated with network capabilities, we are surrounded by an increasing number of IoT devices. Coming together with the popularity of IoT devices are two critical questions.

IoT devices normally come with a "call home" feature, through which users can interact with IoT devices through an App. As a result, users are typically curious about what kind of information they are sending back home.
Along with the facilitation from the "call home" feature, users are also curious about whether/how IoT devices could potentially allow hackers to gain unauthorized access and thus control the device remotely.

To answer the questions above, an analysis framework or tool is usually needed. Unfortunately, there has not yet been an effective, efficient analysis framework or tool available for answering such questions. Today, to analyze IoT devices and the corresponding applications, researchers still heavily rely upon qemu-usermode/qemu. However, it has already been demonstrated qemu-usermode/qemu is a very inefficient solution for IoT because it was designed for Linux and development boards.

In this talk, we will summarize and discuss some common IoT firmwares, which hurdle the analysis of security researchers. Followed by our analysis and discussion, we will then reveal the fundamental problems hidden behind the obstacle. As is specified in our presentation outline, these obstacles include (1) the difficulty of using primitive emulation methods to simulate IoT firmware, (2) the difficulty of using similar specification hardware and general purpose OS to emulate IoT firmware, (3) the difficulty imposed by device drivers and, (4) the concern of insufficient computation and memory resources.

Motivated by our analysis and discussion, we introduce Qiling -- a fully sandboxed, controlled and highly customized framework designed for performing the emulation for IoT devices. In this talk, we will discuss how Qiling Framework empowers security researchers to perform IoT firmware reverse engineering. To be more specifically, we will talk about

- how to emulate various CPU such as ARM, ARM Big Endian, MIPS32, MIPS32 Big Endian, ARM64, X86 and X64;
- how to emulate various OS such as Linux, MacOS, Windows, FreeBSD;
- how to simulate all stdio input and output and thus reply expected results;
- how to build all the network requests through an auto responder in virtualized network
- how to utilize the instrumentation support to redirect code execution whenever is needed
- how to fully customize emulated OS, giving researchers the ability to replace syscall or APIs with their own
- how to enable full CPU control (e.g., updating CPU registers during execution)
- how to support full gdbserver for platform and multi architecture debugging and thus allow allow researchers to use their preferred debuggers for their debugging tasks
- how to enable cross-platform and multi-architecture fuzz testing by integrating it with AFL

Along with this talk, we will share all the firmware that we have tested and will provide a live demo showcasing how easily a researcher can build an isolated testing environment to analyze, instrument, and fuzz a IoT device. In November of 2019, we have already released the source code of our Qiling Framework.

As we all know, many risks are involved with social networks such as impersonation, social-engineering, and data breach.

To demonstrate these attacks, we developed an innovative tool that can hijack and remotely control social network accounts by combining the powers of social engineering with malicious third party apps.

We built a private app store of phishing apps, with genres, that a bad actor can choose from to gain RAT control over victim accounts. To enable this, our tool manages oauth tokens within a single web console, allowing the hacker to exercise the functions of the victim accounts. To this end, we discuss other features and extensions of our tool, such as social engineering chat bots, crawlier bots, password crackers, and visualization tools for social network analytics.

Generally, searching reflected xss in a web-application penetration test is truly a challenge, especially if it consists of a huge number of parameters. Manual fuzzing is too labor-intensive, and moreover, it's easy to miss some details. Reflector is a new Burp Suite extension able to find reflected xss on a page in real-time - while browsing a website. You should not run any active scanning each parameters or test it manually. Every time reflection is found, reflector defines severity and the generated burp issue. Furthermore, it has the below features:

![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
Metasploit and Cobalt Strike are wildly used tool for red-teams, pen-testers and sometimes malicious actors. They deliver a lot of ready-to-use exploits facilitating work of the attacker. But who thinks about the poor blue-team members? They are left alone. It looks automation is for attackers only!
But now, there is a hope: REW-sploit is a new tool with the aim to help defenders in analyzing Metasploit (and in some form Cobalt Strike) based attacks. Leveraging some well know frameworks it can emulate payloads, extracts crypto keys and correlate PCAP dumps to get extra info about what is going on. Automation is now for defenders too!

![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
We believe that cyber security should not only cover the Internet space but also the RF (radio frequency) space.
In the radio space, interception, decryption, tampering, jamming, and spoofing are actively practiced against hostile countries.　For example, the Russian Красуха-4 is a well-known electronic warfare weapon.
In fact, it has a longer history than the Internet, and there is much to learn from it.
However, there are not so many RF training environments that can be easily used.

![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
Software-defined radios (SDRs) are indispensable for signal reconnaissance and physical-layer dissection, but despite we have advanced tools like Universal Radio Hacker, SDR-based approaches require substantial effort. Contrarily, RF dongles such as the popular Yard Stick One are easy to use and guarantee a deterministic physical-layer implementation. However, they're not very flexible, as each dongle is a static hardware system with a monolithic firmware. We present RFquack, an open-source tool and library firmware that combines the flexibility of a software-based approach with the determinism and performance of embedded RF frontends. RFquack is based on a multi-radio hardware system with swappable RF frontends, and a firmware that exposes a uniform, hardware-agnostic API. RFquack focuses on a structured firmware architecture that allows high- and low-level interaction with the RF frontends. It facilitates the development of host-side scripts and firmware plug-ins, to implement efficient data-processing pipelines or interactive protocols, thanks to the multi-radio support. RFquack has an IPython shell and 9 firmware modules for: spectrum scanning, automatic carrier detection and bitrate estimation, headless operation with remote management, in-flight packet filtering and manipulation, MouseJack, and RollJam (as examples). We used RFquack in high-schools to teach digital RF protocols, to setup RF hacking contests, and to analyze industrial-grade devices and key fobs, on which we found and reported 11 vulnerabilities in their RF protocols.

![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
RTOS (Real-Time Operating Systems) are widely used in critical fields such as aerospace, transportation, communication infrastructure, medical devices, oil industry, and industrial robots due to their reliability and stability. However, the real-time nature of RTOS makes the analysis threshold high, resulting in limited security research tools compared to time-sharing operating systems.


RTHunter is an efficient RTOS reverse symbol recovery and vulnerability scanning tool. It collects a large number of RTOS projects and mainstream network framework projects in multiple versions, builds a firmware resource library covering dozens of mainstream RTOS systems, and builds thousands of function features and historical vulnerability function features through trace-based information methods. And by solving the slow recognition speed and accuracy problem of bindiff through trace-based fuzzy feature matching method. RTHunter can achieve more than 50% recognition accuracy on mainstream RTOS routers, and has found supply chain vulnerabilities affecting multiple brands and dozens of RTOS devices through recorded vulnerability features. RTHunter can also use personal reverse information to fill the entire database and form a custom efficient tool.

![BH-US-16](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-US-16-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
In order to optimize testing with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) peripherals, we have created user-friendly tools that enable BLE packet replay, fuzzing, and on-the-fly scripted communications. BLE-replay is a Python tool for recording, modifying, replaying, and fuzzing writes to Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) peripherals. It can be used for testing or reversing application layer interactions between a mobile application and a BLE peripheral. This tool is useful if an application writes some characteristics on the BLE device in order to configure/unlock/disable some feature. You want to quickly capture the relevant information from a packet log into a human-readable format and mess around with it from a laptop. It is the first tool built upon our new BLESuite library.BLESuite is a Python library that enables application layer communication between a host machine and a BLE device. The library greatly simplifies the scripting of BLE activity. It provides a simple connection manager and supports scanning advertisements, service discovery, smart scanning of all services/characteristics/descriptors, and sync/async read/write. We will also demonstrate the BLESuiteCLI, which provides quick access to all of these features from the command line.

### [Remote Assessment and Proctoring using Intelligent Devices (RAPID)](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
Many educational institutions have adopted online proctoring as a mean to conduct and ensure academic integrity during online assessments, spurred by the pandemic. Most of such remote assessment solutions are closed-source, and requires the installation of various libraries or dependencies; this introduces potential risk for students who would not be able to scrutinize, or have a say as to what is installed on their computers. Being closed source, such solutions can also be slow to react to mala fide actions to tamper and bypass measures put in place to deter cheating. In fact, one only needs to perform cursory searches online to find various ways to defeat some well-known closed-source remote assessment solutions.

To tackle the issue at hand, we introduce a proof of concept, open-source system for remote proctoring that does not require prior installation of any software or libraries. It leverages the Raspberry Pi Zero hardware that is programmed to inject fileless scripts into a Windows system to monitor surface level and internal activities during remote assessments. To deter mala fide attempts to tamper with our solution, we incorporate techniques typically used by malware and C2 infrastructure in the development of our solution, with the ultimate goal of using such techniques for good. Hence at the end of each proctoring session, our solution leaves no trace of its presence or any residue within the proctored environment.

Being a proof-of-concept, we envision extending our solution to support other popular operating systems, as well as capture and analyze more data with greater efficiency.

### [Rudra: The Destroyer of Evil](#)  
![BH-ASIA-16](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ASIA-16-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
Rudra aims to provide a developer-friendly framework for exhaustive analysis of (PCAP and PE) files. It provides features to scan and generate reports that include file's structural properties, entropy visualization, compression ratio, theoretical minsize, etc. These details, alongwith file-format specific analysis information, help an analyst to understand the type of data embedded in a file and quickly decide if it deserves further investigation.Rudra is the only tool to provide an effective bot based query mechanism for scanning files. Users can use Twitter and mention a Pastebin link that stores the base64 encoded version of the file to be scanned. It will pull the file from Pastebin, perform base64 decoding, initiate scanning on decoded file, submit base64 encoded json report to Pastebin and post a reply tweet with its link. This provides a quick and effective option to try Rudra without installing it.Rudra supports scanning PE files and can perform API scans, anti{debug, vm, sandbox} detection, packer detection, authenticode verification, alongwith Yara, shellcode, and regex detection upon them. Additionally, following new features are being added for the first beta release:Interactive console providing access to all internal data structures and objects, exposing a rich API for usersPlugin architecture to operate upon decoded file content (usecases might be to write a decoder for a new RAT found in the wild or to write a custom unpacker for a binary stub, etc.)Extracting subfiles and optionally scanning them if neededHeuristics to identify suspicious network flows and exe filesThe report for each analyzed file can be dumped to disk as a JSON/HTML/PDF. If needed, analysis can be customized via CLI arguments, config file, or interactive console.Rudra also supports protocol identification, decoding, and normalization. It can analyze embedded URLs and IP addresses within files and gather whois/geolocation information for them. Users can view live mapping of identified hosts and correlate the results from different analysis modules to perform deeper investigation.


### [Runtime Memory Analysis Tool for Mobile Applications (MemoEB - MEMOry Extraction Binding)](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
We are going to release a tool for automated runtime memory analysis for mobile apps (IOS & Android). All the existing tools are not working with runtime memory analysis processes preferring to dump and analyze memory after app finish it's execution. Our our idea is to gather information during runtime to be able to track changes of the state and application behavior with the final goal being to simplify reverse engineering of obfuscated code and to build call graphs based on catched traces during execution. We also made a single interface to manage this process and automated some most common checks that should be done during penetration test.


### [S-TIP: Seamless Threat Intelligence Platform](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
S-TIP is an open-source platform for those who analyze threats and share the results with CSIRT etc.

There are a variety of CTI (Cyber Threat Intelligence) in the world. "Human CTI" is knowledge of cyberattacks to be consumed by people through social media, email, and other channels. "System CTI" is cyber attack-related knowledge that is consumed by systems in a format that can be understood by computers, namely STIX.

However, there were barriers between Human CTI and System CTI. There were divided and could not be utilized from the other realm. For example, security operators need intensive manual labor to convert a new threat report for human readers into CTI in a machine-readable format for automated defense.

S-TIP solves this problem by integrating Human CTI and System CTI seamlessly through its STIX database to bring down those barriers. When a user creates a new post, it is automatically converted to the STIX file and saved into the database. The system can trigger automated defense by consuming the STIX file. These processes can be done transparently while a user is unaware of the conversion.

Main features of S-TIP are:
1. CTI Element Extractor: Human posts to the social media UI of S-TIP are automatically captured as STIX data.
2. CTI Graph Analytics View: The STIX data can be associated with other pieces of CTI. This mechanism makes it much easier for users to grasp the whole picture of the cyberattack quickly.
3. Integration with Other Platforms: The STIX data can be readily consumed by security tools like MISP, Splunk, JIRA, and Slack.
4. STIX/TAXII - Compliant: Collects CTI from open STIX / TAXII servers on the Internet like AlienVault OTX.

These features support a more predictive and proactive response.

SAIVS can find vulnerabilities such as "Cross Site Scripting" and "SQL Injection".It can output a scanning report. SAIVS can output a scanning report. The report includes target URLs and location of the found vulnerabilities.SAIVS can also perform the following human-like actions: "SAIVS recognizes the type of the page. If it crawls the login page without having a login credential, it creates login credential in the create account page. After it log in with the created login credentials, it crawls the rest of the pages and scans for vulnerabilities. When it finishes all pages, it outputs a scanning report." SAIVS uses machine learning algorithms such as Naive Bayes, Q-Learning, Multi-layer Perceptron in order to achieve one of the aforementioned capabilities: It can crawl simple Web applications. Our session will explain how this ability was made possible by the machine learning algorithms.

### [Safe Scan&C2 Tool](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
In the process of security attack and defense, as well as penetration testing, there are two prominent issues. First, the attack scanning is often detected by the security systems of the defense side, resulting in the scanning IP being blocked. Second, when the defense side is controlled and assets are connected back to the command and control (C2) server, it may be detected by security devices, leading to countermeasures against the penetration testers. In order to safely and conveniently conduct asset detection during the attack and defense process, as well as secure connection back to the controlled assets on the defense side, we have improved the Kademlia protocol and developed a distributed hash table (DHT) technology. We have also developed a networking tool that consists of a large number of Internet nodes, which dynamically updates IDs and node tree structures at regular intervals. This allows each session to initiate requests from a different node during the scanning process, preventing IP blocking due to high-frequency scanning. Additionally, during the controlled asset's connection back to the C2 server, nodes are randomly selected based on user-selected hop count, effectively preventing penetration testers from being traced, thus improving the penetration testing process.


### [Sample Analysing Forensics Examiner (SAFE)](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
Security incidents are usually created by alerts or events, which are based on a small set of forwarded logs. When a server is suspected to be compromised, we go back to the host machine to perform forensics on the rest of the logs to investigate the network traffic and endpoint.

Sample Analysing Forensics Examiner (SAFE) enables security administrators/engineers to run automated forensics investigations effortlessly on a selected set of machines, either specified or via sampling, to get individual baseline threat scores on the likelihood of a server compromise. A number of logs, including web server, syslog, system, network logs are surveyed for this analysis. With SAFE, security engineers can easily survey a selected pool of servers to hunt for any potential infection or compromise.


### [Scared: A Side-Channel Attacks Framework](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
Side-channel attacks regularly get under the spotlight with large scale exploits such as Spectre, Meltdown or very recently the side-channel exploit on the Google Titan security key.

In the background, side-channel attacks have been studied and evaluated in embedded products for more than 20 years. Today, the state-the-art includes multiple attack techniques and countermeasures. Still, open resources on side-channel attacks are limited and it is sometimes challenging to get started with this topic which involves a mix of cryptography, security and data science.

With Scared, our objective is to provide an intuitive Python framework implementing the state-of-the-art side-channel attacks and optimized for analysis of large datasets.

In addition, the project includes a growing set of Python notebooks which provide an easy entry point to the project with examples of how to use the library and apply it on CTF challenges.

Whether you want to learn more about side-channel attacks, do research, or solve some CTF challenges, Scared provides the right framework for you.

If you have been in the industry a little while you start to realize that tools are only as good as their fuzz lists. Great lists are the secret sauce behind mapping, bruteforcing, web exploitation, etc.The SecLists project is a collection of multiple types of lists used during security assessments. List types include usernames, passwords, URLs, sensitive data grep strings, fuzzing payloads, mapping/discovery, and many more. Our goals are to enable a security tester to pull this repo onto a new testing box and have access to every type of list that may be needed. This makes security testers less reliant on one tool and more empowered to write their own (or use the one of their choice).Come check out this project and we will walk you through several usages for the seclists project using your favorite proxies (Burp + ZAP, ++) and show how you can use it to enhance your current testing methodology!

### [Shadow-Box: Lightweight Hypervisor-Based Kernel Protector](#)  
![BH-ASIA-17](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ASIA-17-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
Protection mechanisms running in the kernel-level (Ring 0) cannot completely prevent security threats such as rootkits and kernel exploits because the threats can subvert the protections with the same privileges. This means protections need to be provided with higher privileges. Creating Ring -1 is plausible using VT such as ARM TrustZone, Intel VT-x, and AMD AMD-v. The existing VT (Virtualization Technologies) supports to separate the worlds into a host (normal world, ring -1, host) and a guest (normal world, ring 0 ~ ring 3). Previous research such as NumChecker, Secvisor, NICKLE, Lares, and OSck used VT to protect kernel.In this demo, we show a security monitoring framework for operating systems, Shadow-box, using state-of-the-art virtualization technologies. Shadow-box is introduced at Black Hat Asia 2017 briefing and has a novel architecture inspired by a shadow play. We made Shadow-box from scratch, and it is primarily composed of a lightweight hypervisor and a security monitor. The lightweight hypervisor, Light-box, efficiently isolates an OS inside a guest machine, and projects static and dynamic kernel objects of the guest into the host machine so that our security monitor in the host can investigate the projected images. The security monitor, Shadow-Watcher, places event monitors on static kernel elements and tests security of dynamic kernel elements. We manipulate address translations from the guest physical address to the host physical address in order to exclude unauthorized accesses to the host and the hypervisor spaces. In that way, Shadow-box can properly introspect the guest operating system and mediate all accesses, even when the operating system is compromised.Shadow-box is an open source project (MIT license), and we have been successfully operating Shadow-box in real world since last year. Real world environment is different from laboratory environment. So, we have gone through many trials and errors for a year, and have learned lessons from them. We share our know-hows about using virtualization technology and deploying research into the wild.

![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) provides researchers with a rich data set which can be leveraged both for defensive as well as offensive purposes. ETW collectors can alert the user to malicious behavior such as user-land APC injection from the Kernel, or equally, allow an attacker to spy on keyboard and mouse activity. The scope for ETW research is large but the information security community has been slow to adopt it. The two primary problems with ETW are: the complexities involved in event collection, and the volume of data that is generated.

SilkETW is a flexible C# ETW wrapper which attempts to mitigate the aforementioned issues by providing a straightforward interface for data collection, various filtering mechanics, and an output format that can be easily processed. ETW output can be written locally to disk, to the Windows event log or shipped off (using POST requests) to 3rd party infrastructure such as Elasticsearch.

This project was originally implemented by the FireEye Advanced Practices (AP) team to aid in the rapid analysis of novel attacker trade-craft, and to feed that analysis back into the detection engineering process.

As security professionals, almost every action we take comes down to making a risk-based decision. Web application vulnerabilities, malware infections, physical vulnerabilities, and much more all boils down to some combination of the likelihood of an event happening and the impact it will have. Risk management is a relatively simple concept to grasp, but the place where many practitioners fall down is in the tool set. The lucky security professionals work for companies who can afford expensive GRC tools to aide in managing risk. The unlucky majority out there usually end up spending countless hours managing risk, via spreadsheets. It's cumbersome, time consuming, and just plain sucks. After starting a Risk Management program from scratch at a $1B/year company, Josh Sokol ran into these same barriers and where budget wouldn't let him go down the GRC route, he finally decided to do something about it. SimpleRisk is a simple and free tool to perform risk management activities. Based entirely on open source technologies and sporting a Mozilla Public License 2.0, a SimpleRisk instance can be stood up in minutes and instantly provides the security professional with the ability to submit risks, plan mitigations, facilitate management reviews, prioritize for project planning, and track regular reviews. It is highly configurable and includes dynamic reporting and the ability to tweak risk formulas on the fly. It is under active development with new features being added all the time. SimpleRisk is Enterprise Risk Management simplified.

### [Smalien](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
Investigating how an application handles sensitive information is essential for mobile security researchers to understand behavior of the application and determine whether it is harmless or malicious. Our information flow analysis and information leakage detection tool, called Smalien, should be a good buddy when you start a journey of Android application analysis. Once you give an application to Smalien, it understands the application thoroughly by executing static information flow analysis of Dalvik bytecode files extracted from the application. Smalien performs not only static analysis but also dynamic analysis, implicit information flow detection, and privacy policy enforcement at runtime by parasitizing the application. Smalien instruments additional bytecode to the application, and the bytecode executes dynamic analysis when the application has launched on an Android device.
Smalien has following functions, and we will give a demonstration of it with real-world applications during the tool session.


Smalien analyzes an Android application statically and gathers information of classes, methods, variables, etc.
Smalien presents the results of the analysis graphically such as a method call graph and an information flow diagram
Smalien performs dynamic taint analysis on an Android device
Smalien enforces privacy policy specified by an analyst
Smalien detects information leakage due to implicit information flows
Smalien logs actual information operated by any bytecode or API call, such as http request, at runtime to encourage an analyst in his/her inspection

Using cryptographic hashes (such as SHA1 or MD5) for whitelisting results in some limitations. Machine Learning extensions of whitelisting may be used for execution control, verification, minimizing false positives from other detection methods or other purpose.Locality Sensitive Hashing is a state of the art method in machine learning for the scalable approximate-nearest-neighbor search.The identification of executable files which are very similar to known legitimate executable files fits very well within this paradigm.ToolsWe provide open source tools for the evaluation of TLSH (a locality sensitive hash) of executable programs.We also provide a backend query service which we will make available to researchers on an ongoing basis.In this talk, we show the effectiveness of applying locality sensitive hashing techniques to identify files similar to legitimate executable files. In the demo we will:Give a brief explanation of locality sensitive hashingDescribe typical modifications made to legitimate executable files (such as security updates, patches, functionality enhancements, and corrupted files)Given a program P, demonstrate how the tool can be used to query for similar executable filesDemonstrate how meta data (such as certificates) can be employed to confirm the legitimacy of program P

### [SniperPhish: The Web-Email Spear Phishing Toolkit](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
Spear Phishing campaigns are commonly used to test employees' awareness in a company/organization. This exercise involves mostly the combination of phishing emails and websites. An effective campaign requires sophisticated methods starting from designing a phishing website to executing payload at the target in an undetectable manner. A platform is required to send emails to targeted users and tracking campaign progress. This basically involves the use of a mail server (to send email) and a web server (to host phishing website). To collect campaign data, these two domains need to be considered. Precisely, the campaign required to track email delivery status and the data submitted in the phishing website.

Usually, the data from these two domains can be collected easily, but it is more challenging and time-consuming when these data are to be consolidated and address questions such as which victim in the mail submitted data through the website. SniperPhish comes in handy here so that the data is tracked centrally, and displays the consolidated data in its dashboard.

SniperPhish is an advanced Web-Email spear-phishing toolkit developed in PHP to conduct professional phishing assessments. The abstract idea behind this toolkit is to simulate, combine, and centrally track all campaigns that involve email and phishing websites. SniperPhish supports tracking data from web site containing n number of pages. The data submitted in the phishing website containing multiple pages are tracked sequentially with email campaigns. The advanced customization in the report generation module helps to customize column fields and export in multiple outputs. In addition to the core campaign module, SniperPhish also provides additional functionalities such as hosting phishing websites, payload generation, encryption options, and options to convert payloads to FUD using different methods (eg: conversion to reflective DLL/PE).

Solitude is an open-source privacy analysis tool that aims to help people inspect where their private data goes once it leaves their favorite mobile or web applications. Whether a curious novice or a more advanced researcher, Solitude makes the process of evaluating an app's privacy accessible for everyone.

Unfortunately, privacy policies are often difficult to understand when trying to identify how your private data is being shared and whom it's being shared with. As we have seen through research, privacy policies don't always tell the complete truth of what an apps actual data collection practices are. Solitude was built to help give more transparency to users of where their private data
goes. Solitude makes the process of proxying HTTP traffic and searching through HTTP traffic more straightforward. Solitude can be configured to look for any type of data that you input in a mobile or web application and reveal where that data is going. The application inspects all outbound HTTP traffic, looks for various hashes of your data and recursively decodes common encoding schemes (base64,URL).

### [SysmonX: An Augmented and Community-Driven Drop-In Replacement of Sysmon](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
Sysmon is a free and powerful host-level tracing tool, developed by an epic team at Microsoft, which has been widely adopted and deployed by defenders over the last few years. The tool provides a free alternative for those who want to augment the Microsoft Windows Auditing Capabilities, effectively enabling them to detect anomalous endpoint behaviors and to perform threat-hunting activities over the collected data.

Despite providing a lot of features, Sysmon main disadvantage is around its closed-source nature. Not having the ability to extend the tool data collection or to extend the way that the tool filters, aggregate and logically correlate events are impacting on the tool's ability to keep up with the current threat landscape. What is more, the infosec community is not empowered to fix the well-known subversion and evasion techniques created to bypass tool auditing (i.e Matt Graeber talk at BH USA 18).

Introducing SysmonX: SysmonX is an open-source, community-driven, and drop-in replacement version of Sysmon that provides a modularized architecture with the purpose of enabling the infosec community to:

Extend the Sysmon data collection sources and create new security events
Extend the Sysmon ability to correlate events. Effectively enabling new logical operations between events and the creation of advanced detection capabilities
Enrich the current set of events with more data!
Enable the false positive reduction by narrowing down suspicious events through dedicated scanners
Extend the security configuration schema
React to known subversion and evasion techniques that impact Sysmon, and by doing so, increasing the resilience of security auditing and data collection mechanism such as this one.

SysmonX is composed of a standalone binary that gets itself deployed as a windows service, supports legacy Sysmon configurations and event reporting mechanism, while also providing users the ability to configure all the SysmonX aspects through command-line interface. The SysmonX binary is a drop-in replacement of Sysmon. This effectively means that SysmonX is a feature-compatible version of Sysmon (same input, same output). This is possible thanks to the SysmonX ability to package, deploy, manage Sysmon binaries behind the scene. SysmonX uses this to intercept data collected by Sysmon drivers, enrich them, along with the ability to create, combine, and add scanning logic on top of new security events. The result is a combined output, with the old good features from Sysmon + the new features from SysmonX.

Example of new security events and features added to SysmonX are:

Cmdline and Parent Process Spoofing detection
WMI calls over all the namespaces, not just root:subscription
Ability to collect authentication information
Ability to collect powershell events
Ability to collect DNS lookups
Ability to detect userspace injection techniques (eventing + memory inspection through built in scanner modules)
Ability to perform regex over security event fields
Many more!

### [T3SF (Technical TableTop Exercises Simulation Framework)](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
T3SF is a framework that offers a modular structure for the orchestration of events from a master scenario events list (MSEL) together with a set of rules defined for each exercise and a configuration that allows defining the parameters of the correspondent platform. The main module performs the communication with the specific module (Discord, Slack, Telegram, WhatsApp, Teams, etc.) which allows the events to be presented in the input channels as injects for each platform. Also, the framework supports different use cases: single organization-multiple areas, multiple organization-single area, and multiple organization-multiple areas. It has been successfully tested in exercises with international companies, which allowed us to validate its commercial level.

Tabletop exercises have 2 approaches: traditional (scenarios with discussion) and modern (automatic events on a platform). The 1st platform was funded by the DHS (USA) with USD20 MM over 10 years. In 2021 we proposed a novel approach using free collaborative platforms, which allowed the development of a free and open source framework.

The original research paper presented and published at the IEEE ARGENCON 2022 academic congress, under the title "Cybersecurity Incident Response Simulation for Organizational and Classroom Learning." (preprint available at IEEE TechRxiv).

The tool itself was first presented and released in the most important cybersecurity conference in Spain (RootedCon 2022) and then updated and presented in the most important cybersecurity conference in Latin America (Ekoparty 2022, video available on YouTube). Then it was presented at FIRST Technical Colloquium Amsterdam 2023 (April) and BlackHat Asia Arsenal 2023.

This version is a major update that includes new features like a better GUI frontend for configuration and scenario setup, an automatic inject creation engine based on a given set of parameters (design decisions) and real time interactions based on ChatGPT predefined prompts.

### [THE BICHO: AN ADVANCED CAR BACKDOOR MAKER](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
Attacks targeting connected cars have already been presented in previous editions of BlackHat/Arsenal, as well as different tools to spy on CAN buses. However, there have been only a few attempts to create something similar to a useful backdoor for the CAN bus. Moreover, some of those proofs of concept were built upon Bluetooth technology, limiting the attack range and therefore tampering its effects.

Those things are old! Throughout our research we have successfully developed a hardware backdoor for the CAN bus, called "The Bicho". Its powerful capabilities render it a very smart backdoor. Have you ever imagined the possibility of your car being automatically attacked based on its GPS coordinates, its current speed or any other set of parameters? The Bicho makes it all possible.

All the "magic" is in the assembler-coded firmware we developed for a PIC18F2685 microcontroller. Aditionally our hardware backdoor has an intuitive graphical interface, called "Car Backdoor Maker", which is open-sourced and allows payload customization. The Bicho supports multiple attack payloads and it can be used against any vehicle that supports CAN, without limitations regarding manufacturer or model. Each one of the payloads is associated to a command that can be delivered via SMS, allowing remote execution from any geographical point.

Furthermore, as an advanced feature, the attack payload can be configured to be automatically executed once the victim's vehicle is proximate to a given GPS location. The execution can also be triggered by detecting the transmission of a particular CAN frame, which can be associated with the speed of the vehicle, its fuel level, and some other factors, providing the means to design highly sophisticated attacks and execute them remotely.

![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
Email phishing is the weapon of choice for most attackers and red teamers alike for getting initial compromise on a network. Email phishing awareness is also heightened in today's cyber security atmosphere. What if I told you there's another social engineering method to achieve initial compromise that is largely unnoticed by defenders?

Mobile phones and SMS are technologies that are largely unmonitored by defenders. TapIt aims to exploit scenarios and situations where SMS Phishing (SMiShing) may be used by attackers to achieve their goals, such as initial compromise, credentials harvesting & 2FA phishing.

TapIt allows easy execution of large-scale SMS phishing campaigns, allowing SMS to be sent to large number of recipients, and to follow-up with tracking of these SMS. Its in-built functionality will also allow ease of setup for purpose of credentials harvesting, delivery of payloads and social engineering.

The Volatility Framework is a completely open collection of tools, implemented in Python under the GNU General Public License, for the extraction of digital artifacts from volatile memory (RAM) samples of Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, and Android systems. After last year's Arsenal, we're excited to come back and demo an entirely different set of features, such as:- Extracting injected code and defeating anti-reversing tricks. In particular, we'll repair a PE file whose header(s) have been erased from memory.- How to reverse engineer PlugX and determine what system memory it manipulates to hide its persistence mechanism. We'll use what we learn to design a new Volatility plugin that detects the rootkit trick.- Using the new unified output rendering engine to consume and process large sets of memory artifacts in JSON, SQL, and other formats. In short, you'll learn how to build analysis tools on top of the Volatility Framework.


### [The Vulnerability Complete Definition Library](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
More and more security researchers treat source code as a database and use code patterns to search or query potential vulnerabilities. At the Black Hat 2021 USA conference, the 360 ​​Alpha Lab team disclosed how to use code patterns to find 11 CVEs on Chrome, and developed a 0day exploit based on this. The code pattern is essentially a set of conditions for the code, and the code that satisfies certain conditions is very likely to have vulnerabilities. However, the industry does not seem to have a publicly available tool that can accurately describe or define the necessary and sufficient conditions for a specific vulnerability. Although CodeQL (https://securitylab.github.com/tools/codeql/) is already trying to convert the vulnerability described in natural language in Common Weakness Enumeration (https://cwe.mitre.org/) into query sentences , But most of its query conditions are sufficient and non-essential conditions to form a specific vulnerability, that is, it does not include all the circumstances that form this vulnerability. These query sentences avoid the conditions that CodeQL is difficult to process or describe to improve the success rate of the query. And I personally think that the grammatical rules of SQL often cannot intuitively describe the constraints of the code and the code running process, and a large number of built-in query processes also make the learning cost higher.

Therefore, I have developed a complete definition library for vulnerabilities and believe that this library has two main advantages. First, this library can describe constraints with syntax, design ideas, and keywords similar to the code used by developers, which makes this tool have a lower learning cost. Second, this library is designed to describe the necessary and sufficient conditions for the formation of vulnerabilities. The necessary and sufficient conditions here is used to describe all possible situations that form the vulnerabilities. We should not artificially modify the search conditions to make it easier for the algorithm of the search program to search for results, but should let the search algorithm determine by itself how to search can speed up the display of results.

This library is developed based on LLVM's AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) and the constraint solver STP (Simple Theorem Prover), and supports the description of constraints on objects such as control flow, data flow, value size, variable relations, variable types, variable names, etc. The library will also contain a batch of vulnerability definitions I wrote and a simple search algorithm. I will use a simple example to demonstrate how the algorithm finds a vulnerability in a specific situation based on the vulnerability definition. All source code will be hosted on github, you can download and study by yourself.

### [Threagile: Agile Threat Modeling with Open-Source Tools from within Your IDE](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
If we can build software in a reliable, reproducible and quick way at any time using Pipeline-as-Code and have also automated security scans as part of it, how can we quickly capture the risk landscape of agile projects to ensure we didn't miss an important thing? Traditionally, this happens in workshops with lots of discussion and model work on the whiteboard with boxes, lines and clouds. It's just a pity that it often stops then: Instead of a living model, a slowly but surely eroding artifact is created, while the agile project evolves at a faster pace.

In order to counteract this process of decay, something has to be done continuously, something like "Threat-Model-as-Code" in the DevSecOps sense. The open-source tool Threagile implements the ideas behind this approach: Agile developer-friendly threat modeling right from within the IDE. Models editable in developer IDEs and diffable in Git, which automatically derive risks including graphical diagram and report generation with recommended mitigation actions.

The open-source Threagile toolkit can be executed as a simple docker container and runs either as a command line tool or a full-fledged server with a REST-API: Given information about your data assets, technical assets, communication links, and trust boundaries as input in a simple to maintain YAML file, it executes a set of over 40 built-in risk rules and optionally your custom risk rules against the processed model. The resulting artifacts are diagrams, JSON, Excel, and PDF reports about the identified risks, their rating, and the mitigation steps as well as risk tracking state.

Agile development teams can easily integrate threat modeling into their process by maintaining a simple YAML input file about their architecture and the open-source Threagile toolkits handles the risk evaluation.


### [Threat Scanner](#)  
![BH-US-16](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-US-16-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
Threatscanner is an endpoint IOC scanner. It consumes OpenIOC and Yara rules and scans Windows machines, matching the rules. It produces a report for any matches detailing all the information about the matched items. In addition, it details the logic path used to arrive at the match - showing which predicates in the rule matched and which were missed. The system has many performance optimizations; such as aggregating rules so each potential item is only evaluated once regardless of the number of rules tested. This means that the running time for a single rule roughly matches the running time for 1000s of rules.

Threat hunting using Windows logs is essential for identifying and mitigating potential security threats within an organization's network. It can be a time-consuming and painstaking process due to a large amount of data that needs to be collected and analyzed. The threat-hunting process could be repetitive. However, this process can be improved through custom scripts and tools.

In this talk, we will introduce ThreatSeeker, a windows log analysis framework that allows a threat hunter to find the common threats on the machine quickly. This tool also helps a threat hunter to detect APT movements. ThreatSeeker will allow a user to detect the following attacks:

- Suspicious account behavior
- User Creation and Added/Removed User to Admin group
- Brute Force Attack Detection on SMB, RDP, WinRM, etc.
- Brute Force Attack Detection
- Detection of malicious executable
- Detection of PTH Attack
- Suspicious service creation
- Installed Service with the executable in Suspicious locations
- Detection of Modifying, Starting, Disabling, and Stopping Service
- Detection of special privileges assigned
- Suspicious Command Auditing

Any DFIR analyst knows that everyday in many companies, it doesn't matter the size, it's not easy to perform forensics investigations often due to lack of internal information (like mastery all IT architecture, have the logs or the right one...) and ready to use DFIR tools.

As DFIR professionals we have faced these problems many times and so we decided last year to create something that can help who will need the right tool in the "wrong time" (during a security incident).

And the answer is the Tsurugi Linux project that, of course, can be used also for educational purposes.
After more than a year since the last release, a Tsurugi Linux special BLACK HAT EDITION with this major release will be shared with the participants before the public release.

### [TumbleRF: RF Fuzzing Made Easy](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
We are pleased to introduce TumbleRF, an open source Python framework for fuzzing arbitrary RF technologies down to the PHY. While fuzzing has long been relied on by security researchers to identify software bugs, applying fuzzing methodologies to RF and hardware systems has historically been challenging due to siloed tools and the limited capabilities of commodity RF chipsets.

We created the TumbleRF host-based fuzzing orchestration framework to address these shortfalls by defining core fuzzing logic while abstracting a hardware interface API that can be mapped for compatibility with any RF driver. Thus, supporting a new radio involves merely extending an API, rather than writing a protocol-specific fuzzer from scratch. In addition to enabling traditional MAC-centric fuzzing workflows, TumbleRF's flexibility allows attackers to fuzz and characterize PHY state machines if paired with a Software Defined Radio or a sufficiently flexible commodity radio.

Attendees can expect to leave this presentation with an understanding of how RF and hardware physical layers actually work, and the security issues that lie latent in these designs. Additionally attendees will be empowered to pursue RF vulnerabilities in an automated fashion, which in turn will drive the development and adoption of more secure systems.

### [UFO: A Security Verification Tool for IoT Device Firmware](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
UFO is an IoT firmware security assessment tool that helps firmware developers or security researchers assess the security level of IoT device firmware.

UFO profiles the IoT firmware in many surfaces, like known vulnerabilities, sensitive data, cracked passwords, and hidden backdoors. It saves penetration testers time to gather information and help create attack vectors. Meanwhile, as a handy tool, UFO exposes vulnerabilities as early as possible to mitigate attacks from IoT malware like the notorious Mirai, which also collected default passwords of IoT devices from firmware. We did leverage UFO to pwn two COTS network cameras by discovering their backdoors and default passwords.

Main features of UFO are:
- Known 3rd Party Suite CVE Risk Report: Post-scan report based on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) which is an open industry standard for assessing the severity of computer system security vulnerabilities.
- Sensitive Data Statistics: Assessment of the email, IP, URL, private or password vulnerabilities.
- Cracked Passwords and Certificates Review: Check if your passwords or certificates are vulnerable.
- Shell Dependency Backdoor Paths: Produces a visual guide of backdoor paths.

A full circle of scenarios of using UFO to analysis IoT firmware will be demonstrated.

Among the above features, the source code used to trace shell dependency has been released on Github: https://github.com/dayanuyim/shdep.

### [UNIVERSAL RADIO HACKER: INVESTIGATE WIRELESS PROTOCOLS LIKE A BOSS - ARSENAL THEATER DEMO](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
The spectrum of IoT products expands and with it the number of proprietary wireless protocols raises. Such protocols are designed under size and energy constraints so they tend to have a secondary focus on security. Security researchers can examine arbitrary IoT protocols with Software Defined Radios (SDR) but SDRs present the possibly encoded data in a complex IQ format. Therefore, data has to be to demodulated and decoded before researchers can investigate the actual protocol. After revealing the protocol logic with a differential analysis, vulnerabilities can be found e.g. using fuzzing. Present tools require expertise in Digital Signal Processing (DSP) and/or cover only parts of the process e.g. they only offer support for demodulation but do not help to analyze the protocol logic so researchers need to combine various tools and self-made scripts.

We address this problem with the Universal Radio Hacker (URH) - an open source, cross platform application that integrates the complete hacking process. First, URH performs demodulation with minimal user interaction so no deep DSP knowledge is required. Second, URH helps to reverse engineer the protocol logic by organizing with fields and message types. This can either be done manually or automatically by URH to boostrap a protocol. Third, URH includes a fuzzing component for logical protocol fields whereby the selected encoding and modulation is automatically applied to the crafted messages. URH aims to be both self-contained and expandable: Users find all required steps bundled into one application but at the same time URH provides several interfaces for external tools like GNU Radio so also DSP experts can benefit from it.

The source code of URH can be found at GitHub under https://github.com/jopohl/urh.

Uitkyk is the first Android framework that allows for its implementers to identify Android malware according to the instantiated objects on the heap for a particular process. Uitkyk does not require the APK of the application to be scanned to be present to identify malicious behaviour but instead makes use of runtime memory analysis to detect behaviour which normally cannot be identified by static analysis of Android applications. Static analysis of Android applications is the default approach utilised to identify malicious applications however static analysis has certain shortcomings which Uitkyk addresses by targeting the heap. Uitkyk can be implemented as a standalone library or standalone application on mobile devices.

### [Universal Radio Hacker v2: Simulate Wireless Devices with Software Defined Radio](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
Wireless communication between Internet of Things (IoT) devices is, in many cases, built upon proprietary protocols designed under size and energy constraints. Vulnerabilties in such protocols are critical, e.g. an attacker breaks into a house by hacking a wireless door lock. Software Defined Radios (SDR) offer a generic way to investigate such protocols, but require software support when it comes to demodulating and decoding messages. The Universal Radio Hacker (URH) is an open source tool to support researchers when operating with SDRs by abstracting most of the required HF basics needed for demodulation. Furthermore, it assists reverse engineering the protocol format. While this works well for stateless and undirectional protocols, there are more sophisticated protocols on the market that can not be handled without state machine.

Version 2.0 of the Universal Radio Hacker introduces a Simulation tab that allows to specify a complete HF protocol with several states and participants. It is called Simulation because URH has the ability to play the protocol from the perspective of one or more participants, i.e. URH evaluates all messages towards the simulated participant and dynamically crafts responses depending on the state and previous information. The simulation advancement complies to the easy-to-use philosophy that we also use for the basic URH. Users can see all messages of the analyzed protocol in a graphical flow graph and add new messages, edit or move them around at convenience. Message field values are dynamically derived with access to all previously sent and received information or even by using external programs, e.g. for AES encryption. Conditions, jump and pause elements in the graphical user interface allow generating complex state machines. In our presentation, we demonstrate a practical attack that shows how the simulation component of URH opens a sophisticated wireless door lock (AES encryption) with SDRs.


### [Unleash Purple Knight: Fend Off Invaders Lurking in Your Active Directory](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
Purple Knight is a free Active Directory (AD) and Azure AD security assessment tool developed by Semperis identity security experts that has been downloaded by 5,000+ users since its first release in spring 2021. Purple Knight runs as a standalone utility that queries the AD environment and performs a set of tests against many aspects of AD's security posture, including AD Delegation, account security, AD Infrastructure security, Group Policy security, and Kerberos security. The tool scans for indicators of exposure (IOEs) and indicators of compromise (IOCs). Each security indicator is mapped to security frameworks such as MITRE ATT&CK and the French National Agency for the Security of Information Systems (ANSII).

Purple Knight produces a report that includes an overall score, scores in individual categories, and prioritized guidance from identity security experts that serves as a roadmap for improving overall security posture. The report includes an explanation of what aspects of the indicator were evaluated and the likelihood that the exposure will compromise AD.

Purple Knight is continuously updated to address new security indicators based on original research and in response to emerging threats. As an example, the Purple Knight team released indicators for the Windows Print Spooler service and PetitPotam flaws within days after their discovery. New updates to be demonstrated at Arsenal include:
• Newest in the 100+ indicators of exposure (IOEs) and indicators of compromise (IOCs)
• New Azure Active Directory security indicators
• Post-breach forensics capabilities that enable incident response teams to specify an attack window to accelerate remediation

Purple Knight continuously evolves through feedback from an engaged community of users on the Purple Knight Slack channel and through individual outreach to users who communicate directly with the product teams.

![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
The V2X Validation Tool (called dsrcvt because focused on DSRC technology) facilitates penetration testing on automotive On-Board Units (OBUs) used for Vehicle-to-X communication. Currently, dsrcvt is capable of sending unsigned or signed Basic Safety Messages (BSMs) by re-signing a recorded BSM sent for automotive onboard units. Using these BSMs it tries to cause a surge in an OBU's processing power. It also attempts to bypass the security checks posed by the IEEE 1609.2 security layer. An enhanced version of dsrcvt (dsrcvt-crafter) facilitates crafting entirely custom BSMs from scratch, conforming to the IEEE 1609 standards family. dsrcvt also comes as an OBU fuzzer that can fuzz user-selected fields of a BSM to pen-test OBU implementations.


### [V3SPA: A Tool for Visually Analyzing and Diffing SELinux Security Policies](#)  
![BH-US-16](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-US-16-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
SELinux policies have enormous potential to enforce granular security requirements, but the size and complexity of SELinux security policies makes them challenging for security engineers and analysts to determine whether the implemented policy meets an organization's security requirements. Furthermore, as system complexity increases, so does the difficulty in assessing differential system modifications without requiring a ground up re-verification. Presently, policy analysts and developers primarily use text-based tools such as sediff, grep, and vi to develop and analyze policies. This can be challenging, however, because policies are often composed of tens or hundreds of thousands of rules, which can be difficult to sift through in text-based tools. Some GUI tools exist, such as apol, but these tools do not incorporate visualizations, which can represent dense information compactly and speed up analysis by offloading cognitive processes to the human visual system. In addition, the GUI tools do not support important tasks such as diffing two versions of a policy.To address the challenges in developing and maintaining SELinux security policies, we developed V3SPA (Verification, Validation and Visualization of Security Policy Abstractions). V3SPA creates an abstraction of the underlying security policy using the Lobster domain-specific language, and then tightly integrates exploratory controls and filters with visualizations of the policy to rapidly analyze the policy rules. V3SPA includes several novel analysis modes that change the way policy authors and auditors build and analyze SELinux policies. These modes include:1. A mode for differential policy analysis. This plugin shows analysts a visual diff of two versions of a security policy, allowing analysts to clearly see changes made. Using dynamic query filters, analysts can quickly answer questions such as, "What are the changes that affect passwd_t?"2. A mode for analyzing information flow, identifying unexpected sets of permissions, and examining the overall design of the policy. This plugin allows users to see the entire policy at once, filter down to see only the components of interest, and execute reachability queries both from and to specified domains.As part of our demonstration at Black Hat Arsenal, we will introduce attendees to V3SPA, which we will make freely available online. During our demonstration we will give detailed explanations of V3SPA's algorithms and visualizations, and we will show how V3SPA can be used to assess whether a policy configuration correctly maps to security goals.

### [VT AUTO-X VEHICLE AUTOMATED SECURITY TESTING TOOL - ARSENAL THEATER DEMO](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
Currently, there are some research works on vehicle cybersecurity testing. Many of them are open-source projects, such as CANTact and GoodThopter. CANTact is a popular open-source toolkit available for purchase online that uses SocketCAN to communicate with a CAN bus. Since SocketCAN extends the Berkeley sockets API in Linux by introducing a new protocol family, it is easy to write script languages for CAN message injections. Python is one of the most widely-used script languages for SocketCAN programming. GoodThopter is another recent device targeted at hackers and hobbyists, but is not ready for use as a turn-key solution.

The drawbacks of these open-source tools are that they are not stable and do not work well under heavy-traffic testing scenarios. Also, open-source contributions may not meet the rigorous control and validation requirements of auto industry software practices. We found that it was possible to crash or lock up such tools when injecting them with bursty CAN traffic. For example, CANTact has limited buffer size which may cause buffer overflows. GoodThopter's timeout parameters and configuration file make it hard to work. In our case, we used the serial port for communications and Java as the programming language. Java is preferred over Python as it is faster, more stable, requires strict coding rules, and is better suited to remote control applications.

Cybersecurity testing focuses on finding and identifying unwanted weaknesses or vulnerabilities hiding inside vehicle software. Our goal is to develop an automated and black-box testing tool for OEMs and tier providers to test their vehicles or ECUs with consistent results, which requires no prior detailed knowledge of the testing workflow.

Automation means the tester only needs to follow pre-defined test scenarios one-by-one to finish the whole testing process. Even if the tester does not have prior security testing knowledge or background, he or she can still operate the test device and detect security vulnerabilities by following the automated steps.

Black-box testing strategies should have no prior knowledge of system commands, CAN bus command databases, or the specific manufacturer's practices within the vehicle or system under testing protocols. In this way, OEMs may feel more comfortable with black-box testing since they don't need to release too much of what they may consider to be proprietary system information to internal, outside, or third-party testers.

We have developed the automated automotive cybersecurity testing tool (named VT Auto-X) which has successfully detected serious security vulnerabilities in a number of production vehicles, and has helped several OEMs identify and correct these issues before they became expensive and embarrassing recall programs. It is a black-box test with no prior knowledge of vehicle CAN bus information. Live demonstrations of Auto-X have proven its ability to quickly find software and security vulnerabilities in most of the cars tested.

Auto-X is portable, and can easily connect to a vehicle's CAN bus. The device has a panel which has various types of connection interfaces, including OBD (SAE J1979/J1962) ports and multiple CAN High and CAN Low ports. It incorporates standard banana sockets to facilitate connecting to various vehicle CAN bus accessible points, as well as several power supply options for testing flexibility (bench, garage, mobile). Other connection arrangements are also possible for use when testing individual systems, ECUs, or bench testing components.

A USB 2.0 port is provided to connect to laptops or other computers. Power can also be provided directly via the OBD II connection, by direct 12V DC connection, or via an AC mains adapter power supply. Auto-X also contains several communication modules, such as WIFI, Bluetooth, and 3G, for both short-range and long-range communications making it easy to communicate with remote cloud or smart mobile phones.

Auto-X performs an automated sequence of test scenarios using either the local or cloud-based testing portal. Each scenario test time can range from minutes to hours, which varies depending on the vehicle configuration and equipment. The tool injects CAN traffic into the vehicle CAN bus. By monitoring and recording CAN traffic and responses, the testing portal then analyzes the logs and responses aiming to detect unexpected, unwanted, or potentially harmful security issues.

Auto-X acts as an interface between the entity being tested (an entire vehicle, a single CAN bus, multiple CAN buses, or a component, such as a specific Electronic Control Unit or ECU) and the secure cloud test portal (where the testing scripts reside). It also connects to the user's laptop to control and monitor activity during testing. Once connected to the vehicle, Auto-X can run a series of test scripts or protocols from the cloud portal.

A typical approach towards investigating intrusion incidents is to collect files that might have been dropped from a compromised server. These files could be extracted from network traffic or if we are lucky they could be obtained from the compromised system itself. An analyst can then use her expertise to re-create the attack scenario and understand possible vectors. Depending on her skills, this process might prove easy or extremely difficult. Our aim is to provide a framework that provides a common ground for forensic analysis of network traffic and dropped files using intuitive visualization of structural properties of network traffic and data files, combined with the proven methods of behavioral heuristics.This talk aims to help users understand how to visually classify streaming data such as a network traffic buffer for an active TCP connection or chunked data read from a file on disk. Both these objects under analysis could be considered a binary blobs which could be rendered as an image highlighting the binary structure embedded within them. When this approach is combined with statistical file-format independent properties (like the theoretical minsize, compression ratio, entropy, etc.) and certain file-format specific properties (like the Yara rules matching on parsed HTTP payload or heuristics rules matching on the sections of a PE file), it provides a completely new perspective into the analysis process.Additionally, we want to emphasize on the fact that the most important aspect of analysis process is to quickly correlate attributes and identify patterns. The approach we propose is to minimize the noise and highlight significant behavior using heuristics targeted specifically towards structural pattern identification. The visual representation of the input file provides a concise overview of file's data patterns and the way they are combined together. One glimpse of this visual representation is enough to quickly classify a file as suspicious.In this talk, we will focus on presenting a framework that can help users with forensic analysis of intrusion artifacts using a novel visual analysis approach. This framework could be used to create standalone utilities or to enhance in-house analysis tools via the native API. For quick analysis, users could consume the framework output directly through the packaged commandline tool or via an external log analytic tool like Splunk.

### [Vulmap: Online Local Vulnerability Scanners Project](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
Vulmap is an open source online local vulnerability scanner project. It consists of online local vulnerability scanning scripts for Windows and Linux. These scripts can be used for defensive and offensive purposes. It is possible to conduct vulnerability assessments by using these scripts. Also they can be used for privilege escalation by pentesters/red teamers. Vulmap scans vulnerabilities on localhost, shows related exploits and downloads them. It basically, scan localhost to gather installed software information and ask Vulmon API if there are any vulnerabilities and exploits related with installed software. If any vulnerability exists, Vulmap shows CVE ID, risk score, vulnerability's detail link, exploit ids and exploit titles. Exploits can be downloaded with Vulmap also. Main idea of Vulmap is getting real-time vulnerability data from Vulmon instead of relying of a local vulnerability database. Even the most recent vulnerabilities can be detected with this approach. Also its exploit download feature helps privilege escalation process. Since most Linux installations have Python, Vulmap Linux is developed with Python while Vulmap Windows is developed with PowerShell to make it easy to run it on most Windows versions without any installation.


### [Vulnreport - Pentesting Management and Automation](#)  
![BH-US-16](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-US-16-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
Vulnreport is designed to accelerate management of penetration tests and security code reviews/audits, as well as generation of useful vulnerability reports. Using Vulnreport, security researchers can automate almost all of the overhead involved with penetration testing so that they can devote more time to the fun stuff - finding vulns. Vulnreport takes care of tracking vulnerabilities on your tests, providing a simple UI for managing them, and running analytics on what you're finding and where you're spending your time.Vulnreport is also a platform that can be extended and hooked into whatever other management and vulnerability assessment tools are part of your process. Hook it up to your automated testing frameworks and watch the vuln data flow into your reports like magic.This demo will walk through the upsides of automating this part of your pentesting process as well as show how the Salesforce Product Security team uses Vulnreport to save hundreds of engineer-hours per year. We will be open-sourcing and making the tool available for you and your teams to use, customize, and contribute to during the conference.


### [Vuls: Agent-less Vulnerability Scanner for Linux, FreeBSD, Container Image, Running Container, WordPress, Application Libraries, and Network Devices](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
Over 10,000 new vulnerabilities are registered on the NVD each year. Constantly monitoring new vulnerabilities and keeping a manual inventory of installed software to determine which devices are affected is necessary. Without automation, vulnerability lifecycle managed imposes huge burdens and challenges.

Having personally experienced these challenges, Kota Kanbe created Vuls, an open source vulnerability scanner for Linux and FreeBSD [https://github.com/future-architect/vuls].

With users worldwide, Vuls has over 7,000 GitHub stars and is the highest-ranked security-tool https://github.com/topics/security-tools

Vuls lets you know which servers and software are affected by newly disclosed vulnerabilities. Using multiple detection methods and data sources including changelog, Package Manager, NVD and OVAL, Vuls is more accurate than other open source scanners.

Additionally, using CPE offers a wide detection range. Vuls not only detects vulnerabilities in OS packages but also in non-OS packages such as libraries for programming languages and network devices. https://vuls.io/docs/en/usage-scan-non-os-packages.html Wordpress vulnerability scanning(core, plugins, themes) is also supported. Scan WordPress ... https://vuls.io/docs/en/usage-scan-wordpress.html

Another important feature is the speed; by using parallel processing, numerous servers can be scanned at high speeds with most scans completed within 10 seconds.

Vuls supports major distributions of Linux and FreeBSD as well as containers such as Docker, LXC and LXD.

Vuls is extremely easy to set up since it connects to other servers via SSH for the scans. Of course, it can also be used to scan servers locally without SSH.

Vuls is a Dynamic Scanner which logs in running servers. This means that it's possible to acquire the useful state of the server for system administrators. For instance, Vuls will let you know if there are processes affected by an update and when daemons forgot to perform a restart after the update.

With non-intrusive scans, Vuls works well with Continuous Integration and can help find vulnerabilities very quickly by conducting scans every day.

How can a system administrator automate vulnerability lifecycle management?


### [VxHunter: A Tool Set for VxWorks Based Embedded Device Analyses](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
VxWorks is the industry's leading real-time operating system. It has been widely used in various industry scenarios, which require real-time, deterministic performance and, in many cases, safety and security certifications such as the NASA's Insight Spacecraft. There was lot's of research on Linux based Router and camera, rarely seen research of VxWorks based device.

Most of VxWorks based IoT devices on the market didn't contain any built-in debugger like WDB(VxWorks WDB Debug Agent) or command line debugger. Without debugger it's almost impossible to analyze the root cause of vulnerability or exploit vulnerabilities.

VxHunter contains an firmware analyze tool and an serial debugger tool. The firmware analysis tool is an IDA plugin which can automatically analyze and rebase firmware to correct loading address, fix function name from symbol table, etc. The serial debugger tool is designed for the target which didn't have built-in debugger like WDB. With VxHunter's help, we successfully analyzed and exploited the CVE-2018-19528 vulnerability.

![BH-EU-16](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-EU-16-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
What if the only requirements for taking down a corporate network are 60 minutes and $35? Traditional hacking techniques and corporate espionage have evolved. Advanced attacks nowadays include a combination of social engineering, physical security penetration and logical security hacking. It is our job as security professionals to think outside the box and think about the different ways that hackers might use to infiltrate corporate networks.

The WarBerry is a customized RaspBerryPi hacking dropbox which is used in Red Teaming engagements with the sole purpose of performing reconnaissance and mapping of an internal network and providing access to the remote hacking team while remaining covert and bypassing security mechanisms. The outcome of these red teaming exercises is the demonstration that if a low cost microcomputer loaded with python code can bypass security access controls and enumerate and gather such a significant amount of information about the infrastructure network which is located at, then what dedicated hackers with a large capital can do is beyond conception. The talk will be comprised of slides and a demonstration of the WarBerry's capabilities in a virtual network.

### [WHEN YOU DONT HAVE 0DAYS: CLIENT-SIDE EXPLOITATION FOR THE MASSES WITH BEEF](#)  
![BH-EU-14](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-EU-14-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
A bag of fresh and juicy 0days is certainly something you would love to get as a Christmas present, but it would probably be just a dream you had one of those drunken nights.

Hold on! Not all is lost! There is still hope for pwning targets without 0days.

We will walk you through multiple real-life examples of client-side pwnage, from tricking the victim to take the bait, to achieving persistence on the compromised system.

The examples will be highly practical and will demonstrate how you can do proper client-side exploitation effectively, simply by abusing existing functionalities of browsers, extensions, legacy features, etc.

We'll delve into Chrome and Firefox extensions (automating various repetitive actions that you'll likely perform in your engagements), HTML applications (HTA), abusing User Interface expectations, (Open) Office macros and more. All the attacks are supposed to work on fully patched target software, with a bit of magic trickery as the secret ingredient.

You might already know some of these exploitation vectors, but you might need a way to automate your attacks and tailor them based on the victim language, browser, and whatnot. Either way, if you like offensive security, this is for you.


### [WHID Elite: The Hacking Device for Pwning Computers, Moving Cranes, Exploding Things and Electrocuting Nuts](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
During the last few years, Red Teaming engagements have become more and more popular. This trend pushed some hackers to R&D and release new opensource devices with the intent to make PhySec operations even more interesting. Smoothing the path to new TTPs and improving some old ones. During this talk, I will present two new hacking devices developed from Offensive Ninjas, for Offensive Ninjas:
- WHID Elite (a 2G-enabled offensive device that allows a threat actor to remotely inject keystrokes, bypass air-gapped systems, conduct mousejacking attacks, do acoustic surveillance, RF replay attacks and much more).
- USBsamurai (a Remotely Controlled Malicious USB HID Injecting Cable DIY for less than 10$ that can be used to compromise targets remotely in the most stealthiest way ever seen).


### [WHID INJECTOR - HOW TO BRING HID ATTACKS TO THE NEXT LEVEL](#)  
![BH-EU-17](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-EU-17-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
WHID was born from the need for cheap and dedicated hardware that could be remotely controlled in order to conduct HID attacks (i.e. over WiFi or BLE). WHID stands for WiFi HID injector. It is a cheap but reliable piece of hardware designed to fulfill Pentesters needs related to HID Attacks, during their engagements. The core of WHID is mainly an Atmega 32u4 (commonly used in many Arduino boards) and an ESP-12s (which provides the WiFi capabilities and is commonly used in IoT projects). During the talk we will see in depth how WHID Injector was designed and its functionalities.

WHID Injector was born from the need for cheap and dedicated hardware that could be remotely controlled in order to conduct HID attacks. WHID stands for WiFi HID injector. It is a cheap but reliable piece of hardware designed to fulfill pentesters' needs related to HID Attacks, during their engagements. The core of WHID Injector is mainly an Atmega 32u4 (commonly used in many Arduino boards) and an ESP-12s (which provides the WiFi capabilities and is commonly used in IoT projects).

However, during the last months, a new hardware was under R&D (i.e. WHID Elite). It replaces the Wi-Fi capabilities with a 2G baseband. Which extends its wireless capabilities to (potentially) an unlimited working range. This cute piece of hardware is perfect to be concealed into USB gadgets and used during engagements to get remote shell over an air-gapped environment. In practice, is the "wet dream" of any Red Teamer out there. During the Arsenal presentation, we will see in depth how WHID Injector and WHID Elite were designed and their functionalities. We will also look which tools and techniques Blue Teams can use to detect and mitigate this kind of attacks.

![BH-EU-14](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-EU-14-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
With the PRISM scandal, we began to question whether Microsoft, Google, Apple, and Facebook were the only companies working with governments to spy on the behavior of its citizens. Will WhatsApp be one of these companies? Does WhatsApp store its user conversations? These sorts of things make us think that users are defenseless and have no current measures to ensure the privacy of content shared on these platforms.

The main objective of the research is to add new layers of security and privacy to ensure that in the exchange of information between members of a conversation both the integrity and confidentiality cannot be affected by an external attacker. This is achieved through a system to anonymize and encrypt conversations and data sent via WhatsApp, so that when they reach the servers they are not in "plain text" and only readable to the rightful owners.

WhatsApp Privacy Guard is a tool completely transparent to the users and we will show how this technique can be used against other IM protocols and apps.


### [Wi-Fi Access Point Rootkits](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
Wi-Fi access point (AP) security is one of the most important aspects when it comes to securing networks. The compromise of a Wi-FI AP (which mostly also double-up as a router in SOHO environments) can lead to several secondary attacks. There are multiple vectors that are used to compromise the WiFi AP ranging from default passwords to sophisticated 0-days. But, after compromising the device, avoiding detection and maintaining access are the most important areas which eventually dictate the impact of the compromise.

We are going to release a set of code snippets along with the documentation making it easy for people who want to understand the working of Kernel rootkits for IoT devices like Wi-Fi APs. The code will cover hiding a process, renaming a process, blocking kill command on certain processes, network stack based RAT and much more. The code will be released under GPL v2.


### [WiDy: WiFi 0wnage in Under $5](#)  
![BH-ASIA-17](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ASIA-17-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
WiDy is an open source Wi-Fi Attack and Defense platform created to run on the extremely cheap ESP8266 (<$5) IoT platform. We've written a simple framework which you can hack and create your own tools or automate attack/defense tasks. Among the attacks WiDy is able to perform out of the box, include:Honeypot AttacksCaptive Portal AttacksServing Exploits to browsers using DNS redirectionWi-Fi ScannerWi-Fi Be Gone (similar to TV-be-gone)Sniffing and InjectionBeacon Floods like MDKDeauthentication & DisasscoationClient monitoringWiFi IDS/IPS functionalityâ¦ other interesting applicationsThe key advantage of using the ESP8266 to recreate Wi-Fi attack/defense functionality is that anyone can now build these tools and physically deploy them in under $5 in the field! One can only imagine the kind of projects the community can create once the core code is available to modify and hack. We have also used the Arduino based platform to make it easier to work with our code. Of course, experienced developers can recreate/port this code to work with the manufacturer SDKs or with the Open ESP SDK. The code is written entirely in C.All code and scripts will be open sourced under MIT license and launched at Black Hat Asia Arsenal!

Text editors give us means to manipulate text documents without knowing the character encoding schemes and formatting mechanisms. Vector graphics editors allow us to edit vector based pictures without understanding the underlying vector math.We love Wireshark. It does a fantastic job capturing, decoding and analyzing network packets. But what if you want to edit them?WireEdit is a WYSIWYG editor for network packets. It allows editing network packets at any stack layer without knowing anything about their syntax and encoding rules.


### [Wireshark Forensics Toolkit](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
Wireshark is the most widely used network traffic analyzer. It is an important tool for both live traffic analysis & forensic analysis for forensic/malware analysts. Even though Wireshark provides incredibly powerful functionalities for protocol parsing & filtering, it does not provide any contextual information about network endpoints. For a typical analyst, who has to comb through GBs of PCAP files to identify malicious activity, it's like finding a needle in a haystack.

Wireshark Forensics Toolkit is a cross-platform Wireshark plugin that correlates network traffic data with threat intelligence, asset categorization & vulnerability data to speed up network forensic analysis. It does it by extending Wireshark native search filter functionality to allow filtering based on these additional contextual attributes. It works with both PCAP files and real-time traffic captures.

This toolkit provides the following functionality
- Loads malicious Indicators CSV exported from Threat Intelligence Platforms like MISP and associates it with each source/destination IP from network traffic
- Loads asset classification information based on IP-Range to Asset Type mapping which enables filtering incoming/outgoing traffic from a specific type of assets (e.g. filter for 'Database Server', 'Employee Laptop' etc)
- Loads exported vulnerability scan information exported from Qualys/Nessus map IP to CVEs.
- Extends native Wireshark filter functionality to allow filtering based severity, source, asset type & CVE information for each source or destination IP address in network logs

### [YASUO](#)  
![BH-EU-16](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-EU-16-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
Yasuo is a ruby framework that scans for vulnerable 3rd-party web applications. While working on a network security assessment (internal, external, redteam gigs etc.), we often come across vulnerable 3rd-party web applications or web front-ends that allow us to compromise the remote server by exploiting publicly known vulnerabilities. Some of the common & favorite applications are Apache Tomcat administrative interface, JBoss jmx-console, Hudson Jenkins and so on. Searching Exploit-db will reveal over 10,000 remotely exploitable vulnerabilities that exist in tons of web applications/front-ends and could allow an attacker to completely compromise the back-end server. These vulnerabilities range from RCE to malicious file uploads to SQL injection to RFI/LFI etc.

Yasuo is built to quickly scan the network for such vulnerable applications. Currently, it supports around 150 vulnerable applications. In addition to discovering the vulnerable applications through their unique signature, it also detects if the app requires authentication. If it does, Yasuo performs a brute-force attack against them. In the end, it outputs the IP, vulnerable app url, login status and credentials, if found. Currently, many new features are being added to Yasuo, like smart brute-forcing, internal network pentest mode, new signatures etc.


### [YSO Mobile Security Framework](#)

YSO Mobile Security Framework is an intelligent, all-in-one open source mobile application (Android/iOS) automated pen-testing framework capable of performing static and dynamic analysis. We've been depending on multiple tools to carry out reversing, decoding, debugging, code review, and pen-test and this process requires a lot of effort and time. YSO Mobile Security Framework can be used for effective and fast security analysis of Android APK/Android app source code/iOS app source code.The static analyzer is able to perform automated code review, detect insecure permissions and configurations, and detect insecure code like ssl overriding, ssl bypass, weak crypto, obfuscated codes, permission bypasses, hardcoded secrets, improper usage of dangerous APIs, leakage of sensitive/PII information, and insecure file storage. The dynamic analyzer runs the application in a VM and detects the issues at run time. Further analysis is done on the captured network packets, decrypted HTTPS traffic, application dumps, logs, error or crash reports, debug information, stack trace, and the application assets like files, preferences, and databases. This framework is highly scalable that you can add your custom rules with ease. We will be extending this framework to support other mobile platforms like Tizen, Windows phone etc. in future. A quick and clean report can be generated at the end of the tests.

### [Zelos: Applying Emulation to Cross Architecture Root Cause Analysis](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
Zelos (Zeropoint Emulated Lightweight Operating System) is a python-based binary emulation platform that omits the cumbersome setup of virtual machines, yet provides instrumentation capabilities missing in user-space emulation. While it is built on top of the QEMU powered Unicorn CPU emulator, Zelos provides the operating system details required to fully emulate binary execution from loading, down to system calls. We quickly found use for Zelos as a dynamic instrumentation tool that could unpack malware, categorize and report malicious behavior, as well as extract domains from Domain Generation Algorithms (DGA). The myriad of uses we uncovered drove us to develop a plugin system to encourage extensions.

In this demo, in addition to highlighting Zelos's core dynamic analysis features, we'll showcase a new plugin released at BlackHat which provides automated root cause analysis (RCA), a method of identifying causes of crashes, through data flow analysis. Applications of automated RCA range from helping developers locate and fix bugs to triaging crashes generated through fuzzing. Existing techniques for identifying root cause through data flow analysis may require recompilation of binaries to insert instrumentation, integration of multiple tools, or collecting execution traces. Using Zelos, identifying the root cause can be as simple as providing the binary with the crashing input. We will highlight how we perform architecture agnostic dataflow analysis by utilizing QEMU's internal assembly code representation and show how easy RCA can be, even without source code.

![BH-US-14](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-US-14-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
A world without malware is ideal but unlikely. Many of us would prefer *not* to install another layer of protection on our already-resource-constrained handheld mobile device. Alternatively, Android malware detection sans anti-virus installation has become a reality. Learn about how itâs possible to detect mobile malware using simple text messages with ZitMo NoM. ZeuS in the Mobile, known as ZitMo, is infamous for intercepting SMS transmissions then redirecting them to a Command and Control in order steal banking and personal information. Research with SMS transmissions directed at mobile malware has resulted in the ability to detect ZitMoâs presence without anti-virus applications installed. Turning cyber criminals' tools against them makes this even more of a rewarding endeavor. We are looking for malware researchers to contribute to the continued development of this open tool. The presentation will include the research, the infrastructure, and a demonstration of ZitMo NoM. Live malware will be used during this presentation, assuming we get it to behave.


### [ZoomEye - CyberSpace Search Engine](#)  
![BH-ASIA-16](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ASIA-16-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
ZoomEye is a cyberspace search engine released in 2013. Unlike Shodan which only crawls the port fingerprints of Internet-connected devices and does less work on fingerprint parsing, ZoomEye crawls on not only Internet-connected devices, but also websites to get the fingerprints. All of these fingerprints are powered by our two major engines Xmap and Wmap. Xmap is specialized to port scanning, and Wmap focuses on Web Application fingerprint crawling and parsing.We distribute the crawlers running 7/24 across the world, providing both host device and web application searches to the public by crawling and indexing. Users can also achieve integration and automation with our platform API.This talk covers a basic introduction on our crawling and analyzing architecture, some thoughts on scanning crawling strategies, and the major process on parsing and analyzing devices and website fingerprints.To better understand the complexity of the cyberspace, we work hard on fingerprint parsing and analysis to get more detailed and complete metadata. We think that more accurate and formatted data will do great help to our research. Besides, some cases will be demonstrated in comparison with Shodan and Censys.io to prove our strengths.The ZoomEye 101 section introduces how ZoomEye helps to enhance our research or do some hacking stuff. The audience will learn not only the revolution history of ZoomEye, but also some helpful Internet research methodologies.

### [a bridge to laser beam from IR remote controller](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
This summer, Michihiro Imaoka presented IR-BadUSB at the Black Hat USA 2022 Arsenal. This IR-BadUSB allows an attacker to control a BadUSB plugged into a target's PC with an infrared remote control. Since this IR-BadUSB uses a household infrared remote control, the attacker and the IR-BadUSB must be within the infrared range of this remote control. Basically, the target and the attacker must be in the same room. Therefore, various improvements have been made to extend the reach of this IR-BadUSB.
https://github.com/imaoca/irBadUSBbyButton/blob/master/irbadusb.md

This is one such attempt. This is an attempt to extend the limited range of infrared remote control units for home appliances by converting them into laser beams and irradiating them. Let us explain the method. The module that emits the laser beam has a wavelength of 940 nm, the same wavelength as the infrared ray for home appliances.
The transmitted beam from the infrared remote control for home appliances is received by an infrared receiver such as VS1838B. After adding a 38 KHz subcarrier to the received signal, the laser module is driven by a transistor or similar device.
Perhaps if IR-BadUSB is located near a window, it would be possible to control IR-BadUSB from outdoors. Even if the IR-BadUSB is not near a window, it may be possible to control other IR-BadUSBs if the IR laser beam is reflected and diffused by something inside the room. Infrared light is invisible to the human eye, so the target will not notice it. The only way to prevent this might be to close the curtains or lower the blinds.

Operating the IR-BadUSB with an infrared laser beam does not require a PC or other large device, since it is a remote control for home appliances. If you have a remote control for home appliances that you have used to operate IR-BadUSB, you can use that remote control. No separate programming is required.


### [autoDANE](#)  
![BH-US-16](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-US-16-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
autoDANE: Automatic Domain Admin & Network ExploitationautoDANE is a tool to automate the process of mapping and compromising internal networks. It is available at https://github.com/sensepost/autoDANE Given the prevalence of Microsoft Active Directory domains as the primary means of managing large corporate networks globally; one of the first goals of any internal penetration test is to get Domain Administrator (DA) level access. In demonstration of how common a goal and practise this is, a plethora of tools and techniques exists to assist with this process, from the initial "in" through to to elevation of privilege and eventually extracting and cracking all domain credentials.However, the overall process followed is still manual and time consuming. Even where tools exist, the orchestration from one to the next is manual. The time required both detracts from potentially more dangerous attacks that may be specific to the organisation under assessment, as well as limits those who know of their organisation's vulnerabilities to those with offensive security skills or willing to pay for an assessment. Observing this, we decided to construct a framework for automating such activities. This framework orchestrates the industries currently favoured tools to get DA on internal networks.The goal for the project is to get Domain Admin rights as quickly as possible, so that analysts can start an internal assessment as a privileged user, rather than finishing as one. This will allow analysts to spend time on engagements emulating real life hacking scenarios, such as going after business critical applications, while still comprehensively assessing the internal network. Combining the software vulnerabilities, as well as a realistic idea of how people with malicious or criminal intent might reach them, will provide organisations the information they need to actually improve their defensive posture.For Arsenal, several updates have been made and will be released:Detailed scope definition and proportionality limitsSupport for adding hosts/ranges during runtimeDomain pivot tables-a list of which credentials worked where and which users are in which groupsDetailed filtering and full-text searching across tool-run logsOne click RDP to hosts with confirmed credentialsSQL Server discoveryBasic password cracking when hashes are pulled


### [boofuzz](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
boofuzz is an open-source network protocol fuzzing framework, competing with closed source commercial products like Defensics and Peach. Inheriting from the open source tools Spike and Sulley, boofuzz improves on a long line of block-based fuzzing frameworks.

The fuzzing framework allows hackers to specify protocol formats, and boofuzz does the heavy lifting of generating mutations specific to the format. boofuzz makes developing protocol-specific "smart" fuzzers relatively easy. Make no mistake, designing a smart network protocol fuzzer is no trivial task, but boofuzz provides a solid foundation for producing quality fuzzers.

Written in Python, boofuzz builds on its predecessor, Sulley, with key features including:

Online documentation
More extensibility including support for arbitrary communications mediums
Built-in support for serial fuzzing, ethernet- and IP-layer, UDP broadcast
Much easier install experience!
Far fewer bugs

### [canTot: A CAN Bus Hacking Framework for Car Hacking](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
canTot is a CAN Bus hacking framework that focuses on known CAN Bus vulnerabilities or fun CAN Bus hacks. It is a Python-based CLI framework based on sploitkit and is easy to use because it is similar to working with Metasploit. It can also be used as a guide for pentesting vehicles and learning python for Car Hacking the easier way. This is not to reinvent the wheel of known CAN fuzzers, car exploration tools like caring caribou, or other great CAN analyzers out there. But to combine all the known vulnerabilities and fun CAN bus hacks in automotive security.


### [cwe_checker: Hunting Binary Code Vulnerabilities Across CPU Architectures](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
cwe_checker is an open source suite of tools to detect common bug classes like Use After Free (CWE-416) or Null Pointer Dereference (CWE-476). These bug classes are formally known as Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs). Its main goal is to quickly point analysts to vulnerable code paths in binaries (e.g. firmware) without access to the source code.

cwe_checker is built on top of the Binary Analysis Platform (BAP). By using an intermediate representation for the binary code it can analyze ELF binaries of different CPU architectures, including x86/64, ARM, MIPS, and PPC. It has a modular and extensible architecture implementing static and dynamic analysis techniques. So far cwe_checker implements checks for more than 15 CWE classes including CWE-190 (Integer Overflow), CWE-415 (Double Free), and CWE- 676 (Use of Potentially Dangerous Function).

In addition, cwe_checker has been adopted as a core plugin for the Firmware Analysis & Comparison Tool (FACT). This enables analysts to hunt for vulnerabilities in large firmware data sets. Furthermore, the results of cwe_checker are exportable and there is an IDA Pro plugin that highlights any findings in the binary.


### [eXpose](#)  
![BH-US-16](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-US-16-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
From hiding their tools in innocuous-looking file paths to creating registry keys that hide malicious commands to inviting users to visit deceptive URLs, attackers frequently use deception to penetrate and hide on our networks. Currently our community uses URL blacklists and rule-based detection mechanisms to detect such deception. The eXpose deep neural network, which we will be releasing as free software simultaneously with Blackhat USA 2016, goes beyond these simple methods to provide artificial intelligence driven detection of these objects, detecting upwards of 90% of previously unseen malicious URLs, malicious file paths, and malicious registry keys at low false positive rates.eXpose's approach is based on recent advances in deep learning research, and uses neural network primitives such as character-level embeddings, heterogenously-sized convolutional filters, dropout, and batch normalization to achieve a high detection rate. We compared eXpose to conventional machine learning methods and found that eXpose achieves a significant boost in detection accuracy. In our presentation we will explain how eXpose works, demonstrate how to use it both from the command line and as a Python module, demonstrate its ability to detect new malicious URLs, file paths, and registry keys, and challenge our audience to beat eXpose at guessing which previously-unseen objects are malicious or not.


### [efi_fuzz: Groundwork to the Metaphysics of coverage-guided UEFI fuzzing](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
In recent years, firmware-level attacks against UEFI have grown in popularity and became more and more complex. Prominent examples for such attacks from this year alone include CVE-2020-12890 (SMM callout vulnerability in AMD's Mini PCs), CVE-2020-10713 (BootHole, an effective bypass for Secure Boot) as well as the discovery of a new UEFI implant, dubbed MosaicRegressor. As a growing area of concern, these UEFI vulnerabilities shouldn't be taken lightly. Given any of these vulnerabilities, an attacker can get extremely stealthy persistence on the machine, while bypassing many traditional kernel-based or even hypervisor-based mitigations.

Unfortunately, the set of tools available to the UEFI research community is still in its infancy phase. As a result, most of the research so far was driven by static analysis of UEFI modules or by leveraging some ad-hoc "dumb" fuzzers. Obviously, these approaches have some serious limitations and downsides: static analysis, while not complemented by dynamic analysis, is limited at best and "dumb" fuzzers don't get any feedback from the fuzzed target and as a result are likely to miss key vulnerabilities.

In this talk we'll present efi_fuzz: a modern, coverage-guided fuzzer for UEFI modules based on the Qiling emulation framework and the AFL++ fuzzing engine. The fuzzer is currently capable of fuzzing the contents NVRAM variables and further work is being made to support fuzzing of other attack vectors such as SWSMIs.

### [goKey: Reclaim Back Keys for Your Kingdom - A Vaultless Password Manager](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
The password is the oldest and most widely used pillar of authentication. We use passwords everywhere: from everyday online shopping to accessing government services and managing our money. Every day, the number of online services increases and each of service most likely requires a password to use it.

On the other hand, as password-cracking techniques increase and evolve, so do the restrictions on the types of passwords we can use. It is not enough anymore to use your favourite movie as a password across all your accounts. The modern Internet threat model requires passwords to be either ridiculously long or look like random gibberish of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers and special characters. And in NO WAY should you reuse same password on any two services. In other words, the most secure passwords are hardly memorable to ordinary people and the number of passwords you have to remember makes this task even harder.

That's where password managers kick in. Instead of remembering each password, you only have to remember the password for your password manager (the "master password"), and the password manager remembers your other passwords for you. But how? They store your other passwords in a vault (a simple encrypted database). However, as with any database, a vault requires management: you need to store it somewhere (which means more backups), sync it across all your devices (you definitely want to access your services from home/work laptops, smartphone, tablet etc). And as with any database management, there comes usability and security issues. Basically, you either have to manually update and manage the vault yourself (if you use a free open-source password manager) or rely on some kind of cloud-based service (often paid and proprietary) for that.

So it is a matter of usability vs security: either you're using a convenient proprietary password manager and have no idea if it is working as advertised, or you have more confidence in your open-source password manager, but have to deal with your vault yourself.

Wouldn't it be great to have a password manager without a vault? We would no longer have to manage vaults or rely on any third parties. This presentation introduces an open-source vaultless password manager, which does not store your passwords, but rather derives them from the master-password in a cryptographically secure manner. There is an option to generate secure cryptographic keys so that your passwords/keys are never stored anywhere, but can be reliably regenerated when needed.

![BH-EU-14](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-EU-14-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
In 2008, we released reDuh (http://research.sensepost.com/tools/web/reduh), a network-tunneling tool that allowed port forwarding via a web-shell and HTTP/S to backend services. reDuh has since become part of any attackers standard toolkit, featured in several books and notoriously described as "insidious" by HBGary in their leaked e-mails.

However, when doing any sort of tunneling, targeting multiple hosts and ports can be frustrating as it requires a tunnel to be setup for each unique host:port combination. Enter reGeorg; this is a rewrite of reDuh to support a full SOCKS4/5 proxy interface. This allows one tunnel to be used to make multiple connections, including port scans. Additionally, capabilities to take advantage of HTML5 websockets (where available) have been built for faster connections.

In short, if you can get a webshell up, you can use reGeorg to gain access with your favorite tool (Nmap, Metasploit, etc.) to the entire internal network range your compromised server has access to.

The list of currently supported web frameworks are: ASP.NET, JSP, PHP, ASP. The list of currently supported transports are: HTTP, HTTPS, HTML5 WebSockets.

![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Uncategorized](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Uncategorized-gray)  
Public GitHub is the most common place where developers share their code and tools that they develop (i.e., developed for an organization or themselves). Most developers and repository contributors do their best to remove sensitive information before they push their code into the GitHub. However, there are developers who often unknowingly/inadvertently neglect to remove sensitive information such as API tokens and user credentials (username & passwords) from their code prior to posting it. As a result, an organization's internal secrets and token are exposed publicly. Therefore, an unauthorized access to the secrets GitHub by bad actors can have significant consequences for organizations. In order to address the issue, we offer xGitGuard, a full-fledge AI-based tool that detects organizations' secrets and user credentials posted on the public GitHub in a scalable and timely-manner fashion. xGitGuard, takes advantage of a new text processing algorithm that can find secrets within files with a high level of accuracy. This can significantly help operations to take proper actions in timely manner.

![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-OSINT](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-OSINT-gray)  
In the ever-evolving cybersecurity landscape, the identification and acknowledgment of vulnerabilities through the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) system play a crucial role. However, vendor discretion in determining whether a security issue warrants a CVE assignment often results in overlooked vulnerabilities that pose significant risks. This presentation introduces the !CVE initiative, a groundbreaking platform that addresses this critical gap by identifying, tracking, and sharing unacknowledged cybersecurity vulnerabilities.

Our presentation begins with an overview of the CVE system and the challenges security researchers face in dealing with unacknowledged vulnerabilities. We discuss real-world examples of security issues ignored by vendors and explore the potential consequences of these hidden threats. We then delve into the !CVE platform, detailing its mission, features, and collaborative approach to empower the security community.

Through case studies, we demonstrate the value of the !CVE initiative in strengthening the cybersecurity ecosystem, highlighting the significance of addressing vulnerabilities not recognized by vendors. We also showcase the reporting process, expert panel, and public availability of !CVE reports, fostering a transparent and inclusive environment for vulnerability tracking and sharing.

Join us in exploring the world of unacknowledged cybersecurity vulnerabilities and learn how the !CVE initiative is bridging the gap between vendor discretion and community-driven security efforts. By raising awareness and fostering collaboration, we can create a more secure and resilient digital landscape for all.

### [Manuka: A modular, scalable OSINT honeypot targeting pre-attack reconnaissance techniques](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-OSINT](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-OSINT-gray)  
Manuka is an Open-source intelligence (OSINT) honeypot that monitors reconnaissance attempts by threat actors and generates actionable intelligence for Blue Teamers. It creates a simulated environment consisting of staged OSINT sources, such as social media profiles and leaked credentials, and tracks signs of adversary interest, closely aligning to MITRE's PRE-ATT&CK framework. Manuka gives Blue Teams additional visibility of the pre-attack reconnaissance phase and generates early-warning signals for defenders.

Although they vary in scale and sophistication, most traditional honeypots focus on networks. These honeypots uncover attackers at Stage 2 (Weaponization) to 7 (Actions on Objectives) of the cyber kill chain, assuming that attackers are already probing the network.

Manuka conducts OSINT threat detection at Stage 1 (Reconnaissance) of the cyber kill chain. Despite investing millions of dollars into network defenses, organisations can be easily compromised through a single Google search. One recent example was hackers exposing corporate meetings, therapy sessions, and college classes through Zoom calls left on the open Web. Enterprises need to detect these OSINT threats on their perimeter but lack the tools to do so.

Manuka is built to scale. Users can easily add new listener modules and plug them into the Dockerized environment. They can coordinate multiple campaigns and honeypots simultaneously to broaden the honeypot surface. Furthermore, users can quickly customize and deploy Manuka to match different use cases. Manuka's data is designed to be easily ported to other third-party analysis and visualization tools in an organisation's workflow.

Designing an OSINT honeypot presents a novel challenge due to the complexity and wide range of OSINT techniques. However, such a tool would allow Blue Teamers to "shift left" in their cyber threat intelligence strategy.


### [New Face, Who Dis? Protecting Privacy in a World of Surveillance](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-OSINT](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-OSINT-gray)  
While it has its potential benefits, facial recognition is eroding privacy and other human rights. Over the past year, several organizations have acknowledged that they have "scraped" social media and similar sites for photos to build their biometric databases, and photos intended for personal use only have now been potentially weaponized.

Industry and government have ethical responsibilities to prevent this, but what if there were a way to enhance privacy for individuals without waiting for the cavalry? Adversarial technology can provide a way to protect this biometric, but it must be as easy to use as picking up their mobile device and taking a photo.

Introducing "Ruse," a mobile app that seeks to use adversarial strategies to make personal photos less useful for commercial facial recognition systems while retaining a (relatively) low impact on human usefulness.


### [OSRFRAMEWORK: OPEN SOURCES RESEARCH FRAMEWORK](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-OSINT](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-OSINT-gray)  
OSRFramework is a GNU AGPLv3+ set of libraries modularly developed by Yaiza Rubio and Félix Brezo to perform Open Source Intelligence tasks. In the framework, the authors include a series of applications related to username checking, DNS lookups, social media research, regular expressions extraction and many others. At the same time, by means of ad-hoc Maltego transforms, OSRFramework provides a way of making these queries graphically as well as including other interfaces to interact with it using the command line and a web server.

The most important tools included in the framework are:

usufy.py. Application focused on checking the existence of different usernames in up to 309 platforms (as May 4th, 2017).
domainfy.py. Application focused on finding existing domains and common subdomains that currently resolve to IP addresses (more than 1500 possible domains checked). Whois information is retrieved when possible.
mailfy.py. Application that validates the existence or not of an email account in more than 20 different email providers.
Other tools included are: alias_generator.py, phonefy.py and searchfy.py as well as osrfconsole.py (msfconsole-like command line GUI), osrframework_server.py (a Web interface that includes an API) and several local Maltego transforms and entities.
Amongst the capabilities included, it is possible to export to several formats (.csv, .xls, .xlsx, .gml, etc.), to configure the number of threads and proxy settings and to define the credentials to be used if the forum enforces it.

As each security analyst may be facing different information needs, the tool has been conceived to be easily configurable so as to include new local sources. By means of plugins that analysts can add locally using the templates provided by the authors, security researchers will be able to adapt the tool to his/her own specific needs at any time.


### [Octopii - AI-powered Personal Identifiable Information (PII) scanner](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-OSINT](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-OSINT-gray)  
Octopii is an open-source AI-powered Personal Identifiable Information (PII) scanner that can look for image assets such as Government IDs, passports, photos and signatures in a directory.


### [Octopii v2](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-OSINT](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-OSINT-gray)  
Today, given the number of services that collect Personal Identifiable Information (PII) for purposes such as 'KYC' (Know Your Customer) documents, bureaus keeping records of people, small businesses keeping records of their employees, and so on, PII faces a wide variety of threats. With increasing security breaches, protecting valuable data such as Personal Identifiable Information must be the top priority of all organizations. The first step in accomplishing this is to identify the exposure of such assets.

This is why we created Octopii, an AI-powered Personally Identifiable Information (PII) scanner that uses Optical Character Recognition (OCR), regular expression lists and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to search public-facing locations for Government ID, addresses, emails etc in images, PDFs and documents.


### [PROJECT SPLINTER - MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS BASED ON CYBER THREAT INTEL](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-OSINT](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-OSINT-gray)  
Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) form a core component of a security analyst's decision making process, but there is very little emphasis paid to recognizing their dynamic nature in the overall analysis. Adversaries are dynamic entities that adapt to their environment and change their tactics and techniques with time. Our goal is to bring a scientific approach to cyber threat analysis by utilizing Bayesian inference to reduce uncertainty in decision making. We will present a tool that calculates statistical probabilities for assigning classification labels to campaign or malware families based on observed IoC's. This tool also allows analysts to take into account temporal quantity of the observations to strengthen this statistical inference. To demonstrate the capabilities of the tool we will use the Fidelis Barncat Threat Intelligence dataset. The Barncat dataset represents an acceptable ground truth for the past state of the world, which can be used to informed new observations. We will show how the tool allows to backtest classification models using this dataset and propose security centric decision metrics for identifying the most optimal model.


### [PasteHunter: Scanning Pastebin with Yara Rules](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-OSINT](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-OSINT-gray)  
From a security analytics and Threat Intelligence perspective, Pastebin is a treasure trove of information. All content that is uploaded to Pastebin and not explicitly set to private (which requires an account) is listed and can be viewed by anyone.

Hackers and script kiddies are quick to push their warez on to the site for the world to see and developers/network engineers are prone to accidentally leaking internal configurations and credentials. Anyway, how can we the lowly security analyst sift through all this data and use it to our advantage? We can scrape Pastebin and check all the data uploaded to see if any of it is of interest to us. There are some tools that can monitors paste sites with a set of regular expressions but I wanted more control and flexibility.

Having used Yara extensively in Malware analysis and Threathunting I saw it as a powerful method for quickly scanning large amounts of data and identifying the contents.

Over the last two years of development Pastehunter has grown to include modular inputs that can read from any data source and process the data in to a searchable indexed data set that also has the ability to send notifications with minutes of data matching your rules going public.

Inputs include Pastebin, Github Gists and all StackExchange posted questions. Ouptuts include Elastic Search and SMS / WhatsApp / Slack amongst others.


### [Quark Engine: Storyteller of Android Malware](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-OSINT](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-OSINT-gray)  
Quark is one of the most popular analysis engines for hunting threat intelligence inside the APK files. Since it is rule-based, you can use the ones built-in or customize as needed.

With ideas decoded from criminal law, Quark has its unique angles for malware analysis. We developed a Dalvik bytecode loader that has tainted analysis inside but also defeats the obfuscation techniques used against reverse engineering. And surprisingly, the loader matches perfectly the design of our malware scoring system.

Features/Progress in recent versions of Quark:
1. Public Reports: AhMyth RAT and Roaming Mantis. And we give out all detection rules used in the reports
2. Call Graphs for behavior detected
3. Behavior Classification
4. New Strategy for Generating Rules
5. Open-Sourced all codes for rule generation
6. Python Binding APIs: Made Quark easy to be integrated.
7. Integrated to Intel Owl, BlackArch Linux, Pithus/Bazaar and APKLAB

In recent versions of Quark, we put huge efforts into making it more useful and practical. We have public reports that analyze classic samples like AhMyth RAT and Roaming Mantis. And we gave out all detection rules used in these reports!

In those reports, we show how users can use new features of Quark to quickly realize how the malware works. For example, malware analysts now can use Quark to generate call graphs of each behavior detected. And we also provide a feature that can automatically classify the detected behaviors in APK so as to boost up the storytelling of malware.

Moreover, to make Quark a more practical tool to use, we developed a new strategy for generating detection rules. The new strategy improves the effectiveness of the rules and efficiency of the generating process. Even better, we open-sourced all codes for everyone.

With the usefulness of Quark, we now have developed python binding APIs for integration with other open-source projects. Now you can use Quark in projects like Intel Owl, BlackArch Linux, Pithus/Bazaar, and APKLAB. We'll be demonstrating how Quark enriches our partners during the presentation.


### [RTS: Real Time Scrapper](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-OSINT](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-OSINT-gray)  
RTS (Realtime scrapper) is a tool developed to scrap all pasties, github, reddit, etc. in real time to identify occurrence of search terms configured. Upon match, an email will be triggered. Thus, allowing a company to react in case of leakage of code, any hacks tweeted, etc. and harden themselves against an attack before it goes viral.


### [RTTM: Real Time Threat Monitoring Tool](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-OSINT](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-OSINT-gray)  
Monitoring possible threats of your company on the Internet is an impossible task to be achieved manually. Hence, many threats of the company go unnoticed until it becomes viral in public - thus causing monetary/reputation damage. This is where RTTM comes into action. RTTM (Real-Time Threat Monitoring Tool) is a tool developed to scrap all pasties, GitHub,reddit..etc in real-time to identify an occurrence of search terms configured. Upon a match, an email will be triggered. Thus allowing the company to react in case of leakage of code, any hacks tweeted..etc.. and harden themselves against an attack before it goes viral.

Over the past 2 years, the tool has evolved from a simple search. Artificial intelligence has been implemented to perform a better search. If regex is needed even that is supported. Thus, behavior is close to human and reduces false positives.

The best part of the tool is that alert will be sent to email in less than 60 seconds from the time threat has made it to the internet. Thus allowing response in real-time to happen.

The same tool in malicious user hands can be used offensively to get an update on any latest hacks, code leakage, etc..


### [Recon.Cloud - Cloud Attack Surface Management and Cloud Reconaissance](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-OSINT](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-OSINT-gray)  
Recon.Cloud is a public and free AWS cloud security reconnaissance tool that will enable users to reveal publicly exposed cloud assets on any domain. There are many tools in the market that are open to users for reconnaissance efforts, but there are few that specifically scope recon efforts to look at the cloud alone. Typical recon tools provide an exhaustive list of all assets they detect – there is no scope to define the cloud assets themselves. This leaves users overwhelmed with too much information that can be difficult and time-consuming to comb through.


### [ReconPal: Leveraging NLP for Infosec](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-OSINT](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-OSINT-gray)  
Recon is one of the most important phases that seem easy but takes a lot of effort and skill to do right. One needs to know about the right tools, correct queries/syntax, run those queries, correlate the information, and sanitize the output. All of this might be easy for a seasoned infosec/recon professional to do but for rest, it is still near to magic. How cool it will be to ask a simple question like "Find me an open Memcached server in Singapore with UDP support?" or "How many IP cameras in Singapore are using default credentials?" in WhatsApp chat or a web portal and get the answer?

The integration of GPT-3, deep learning-based language models to produce human-like text, with well-known recon tools like Shodan is the foundation of ReconPal. In this talk, we will be introducing ReconPal with report generation capabilities and interactive terminal sessions. We are also introducing a miniature attack module, allowing users to execute popular exploits against the server with just the voice commands. The code will be open-source and made available after the talk.

![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-OSINT](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-OSINT-gray)  
Social Mapper is a Open Source Intelligence Tool that uses facial recognition to correlate social media profiles across different sites on a mass scale. It takes an automated approach to searching popular social media sites for targets names and pictures to accurately detect and group a person's presence, outputting the results into report that a human operator can quickly review.

Social Mapper has a variety of uses in the security industry, for example the automated gathering of large amounts of social media profiles for use on targeted phishing campaigns. Facial recognition aids this process by removing false positives in the search results, so that reviewing this data is quicker for a human operator.

Social Mapper supports the following social media platforms:

LinkedIn
Facebook
Twitter
GooglePlus
Instagram
VKontakte
Weibo
Douban

Social Mapper takes a variety of input types such as:

An organisation's name
A folder full of named images
A CSV file with names and url's to images online


### [Spartacus as a Service (SaaS): Privacy via Obfuscation](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-OSINT](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-OSINT-gray)  
The Third Servile War was over. The slave army has been defeated, and the survivors are offered a pardon by their Roman captors. The only requirement was that they identify Spartacus, their leader (Kirk Douglas). Rather than give away his identity, however, they all begin to yell out "I'm Spartacus!"—thus preserving his anonymity by overwhelming the Romans with possibilities. (Spoiler alert: they all die as a result.)

Since users cannot rely on governments to ensure privacy, a different method of privacy assurance is proposed: privacy through obfuscation.

"Spartacus as a Service (SaaS)" is an open-source proof-of-concept is introduced that facilitates these obfuscation techniques. This will allow for automatic obfuscation of a chosen identity on a small scale, and lessons learned from its usage will be discussed.

Additional information:

Current version at: https://github.com/derrumbe/Spartacus-as-a-Service
Open-source tool written largely in Node.js under an MIT license
Development is ongoing, and this is expected to be a long-term project (first official release would coincide with BlackHat/DefCon)
Authorization for obfuscation is done via OAuth for a signed in user (explicit consent is therefore given)
Additional resources have been incorporated to accommodate this content. A Markov chain is used to generate new content based on a textual repository (ranging from political platforms to the oft-used Jane Austen canon to Aaron Franklin's book on BBQ (he's a big deal here in Austin.)) Amazon Mechanical Turk may be used to circumvent bothersome pieces such as captchas.
Note that this is not a tool that *prevents* targeted advertising and the like, instead it seeks to dilute the value of information that companies know about a user, masking the true information from the fake, so that it is impossible to tell what the real content (or in some cases, who the person) actually is.

![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-OSINT](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-OSINT-gray)  
Keeping up with the evolving landscape of attacker techniques can feel like an uphill battle. Many organizations use a SIEM to perform log correlation and analysis and can attest that keeping rules current is a challenge. To combat the burden of keeping pace with the offensive community, this presentation will detail a new initiative to develop, share, and assess the latest and greatest in alerting logic—the Threat Alert Logic Repository (TALR). TALR is a repository of curated SIEM rules, designed for quick and easy ingestion in to the SIEM tool of your choice. The TALR repository is a publicly available TAXII server intended to keep SIEM engineers and analysts up-to-date on the latest and greatest detection logic. The TALR agent will provide a means to submit new rules to the repository, and to download updates for the latest detection rules (using our repository, or any TAXII server hosting TALR formatted SIEM content).

Attendees will gain a comprehensive overview of TALR and understand how to incorporate it into their environments as a way to remain on the cutting edge of alerting logic, and as a means of enacting more contextualized and informed response.

### [TheTHE: The Thread Hunting Experience](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-OSINT](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-OSINT-gray)  
TheTHE is an environment intended to help analysts and hunters over the early stages of their work in an easier, unified and quicker way. One of the major drawbacks when dealing with a hunting is the collection of information available on a high number of sources, both public and private.

All this information is usually scattered and sometimes even volatile.

Perhaps at a certain point there is no information on a particular IOC (Indicator of Compromise), but that situation may change within a few hours and become crucial for the investigation.

Based on our experience on Threat Hunting, we have created a free and open source framework to make the early stages of the investigation simpler from:

- Automation of tasks and searches.

- Rapid API processing of multiple tools.

- Unification of information in a single interface, so that screenshots, spreadsheets, text files, etc. are not scattered.

- Enrichment of collected data.

- Periodic monitoring of a given IOC in case new information or related movements appear.

TheTHE has a web interface where the analyst starts its work by entering IOCs that will be sent to a backend, where the system will automatically look up for such resource on the various configured platforms in order to obtain unified information from different sources and access related reports or data existing on them. Furthermore, any change in the resources to be analyzed will be monitored.

Everything is executed on a local system, without needing to share information with third parties until such information is not organized, linked, complete and synthesized. This allows that in case the information must be analyzed on any other platform later (such as a Threat Intelligence Platform), it can be done in the most enriching possible manner.


### [Token-Hunter & Gitrob: Hunting for Secrets](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-OSINT](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-OSINT-gray)  
Secrets like API tokens, encryption keys, and passwords are a keystone in the development world. They facilitate important functionality not only in the software that developers build, but also in the deployment, maintenance, integration, and security of both closed and open-source projects. Many companies providing services on the internet offer API tokens in multiple flavors that allow interaction with their systems, as does GitLab. Token-Hunter and Gitrob are complementary tools developed, augmented, and heavily used by GitLab's red team to support their engagements and, most importantly, find those exposed secrets and demonstrate their abuse!


### [WhiteRabbit: Combining Threat Intelligence, Public Blockchain Data, and Machine Learning to go Down the "Dirty Money" Rabbit Hole](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-OSINT](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-OSINT-gray)  
WhiteRabbit will be used to demonstrate how machine learning models can be used on a merged dataset combining cyber related contextual information with Bitcoin (BTC) transaction data. The model can be used by both private and public sectors security professionals, working in the cryptocurrency field, to deny business for certain BTC addresses or, build legal cases to return illegally stolen coins.

To build the dataset, we collected a list of BTC addresses involved in illegal activities. Using these addresses as a starting point, we navigated along the chain, and reconstructed a cluster of connected "dirty" addresses. We used rules such as First-In-First-Out (FIFO) to label them. These labeling techniques can be used to tag certain BTC addresses that fall within this path as "dirty" addresses because they handled money acquired through illegal activities. We can then take this a step further and analyze the characteristic behavioral elements of these addresses. This behavioral analysis will allow us to determine the features representing this malicious behavior and use them within a machine learning model classifying new BTC addresses.

Our model-building approach is based on a three part framework: The first part is to collect a set of BTC addresses and classify them as "clean" or "dirty" to use them as our ground truth. The second part is to test the classification models using this dataset and propose decision metrics to optimally pick a model. In this part, we will also discuss ideas about how to compute expensive, but important features obtained from transaction data stored on a graph database. In the third part, we will show how to use the obtained optimal model to predict if an address is "dirty". Finally, we will discuss our challenges when solving this problem and propose solutions to overcome them.

One of the main benefits of cloud technology is to deploy quickly services, with minimum interaction from the administrator side, this is an advantage exploited by cyber criminals too. Nowadays the main threats all size companies are facing is phishing, every day cybercriminals are creating more sophisticated techniques to cheat users and make more difficult the job of blue teams. The most common technique used is typo squatting.

Part of the Blue team mission is to detect phishing, typo squatters, and attack domains before the phishing campaign begins, there is outside plenty of tools trying to detect that domains based on DNS, however none of them are focus into the cloud.
0365Squatting is a python tool created to identify that domains before the attack start. The tool can create a list of typo squatted domains based on the domain provided by the user and check all the domains against O365 infrastructure, (these domains will not appear on a DNS request).

At the same time, this tool can also be used by red teams and bug bunters, one of the classic attacks is the domain takeover so, the second option of this too is to check if the domain is registered in O365 in order to launch a domain takeover attack.

### [ANWI (All New Wireless IDS): The $5 WIDS](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection-gray)  
ANWI is a new type of Wireless Intrusion Detection System which is based on a low cost WiFi module (ESP8266) and can be deployed at physical perimeter of the coverage area. It allows organizations which can't afford expensive WIDS solutions to protect their networks at fraction of the cost involved.

ANWI provides three layers of protection:

Detect the most commonly used WiFi attacks including Evil Twin, Jamming using de-authentication frames, attacks conducted using commonly used WiFi attack frameworks
Block unauthorized WiFi Access Points created in organization premises
Secure organizations AP by performing WiFi Geo-Fencing to prevent access outside of designated perimeter

ANWI supports standalone as well as managed mode for sending alerts. It also has ability to use separate radio for sending alerts as added resiliency.ANWI aims to fulfill the need of WIDS which is inexpensive yet can protect against most of the possible attacks. It is easy to setup and deploy and works on "fire and forget principle". Once the sensors have been configured they can be deployed across the perimeter. The sensors send heartbeat signal and in case any of the sensors goes offline an alert is generated by server. The current production version includes all the above features.

### [ATT&CK Framework: Endpoint Detection Super Powers on the Cheap with Sysmon and Splunk](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection-gray)  
By using the ATT&CK framework as a basis for hunting the likelihood of catching at least part of the attackers trail is significantly increased. To make use of this rich data source I will demonstrate a Threat Hunting application which will guide your investigation along all covered ATT&CK techniques.

I will release the (Mandatory Manual Learning) ThreatHunting Splunk app I've developed, which at the time of writing contains over 80 (multi)searches and over 10 dashboards leveraging summary indexes, custom visualisations and a rich set of workflow actions.
These dashboards contain overviews, threat indicators and facilitate consecutive drilldown workflows to help the analyst determine whether this is a threat or not and also provides a whitelisting option for false positives.

Knowledge is power; the workflow has been intentionally built on generic searches to cover all attack variations, in the beginning this will generate quite some false positives. It might not appear so but this is a great thing, it will teach the hunters a great deal about their environment and therefore over time they'll be more efficient in detecting malicious behavior.

Many expensive Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) tools are available, but the high cost and effort required to deploy agents to every host can be offputting to companies. The Automated Collection and Enrichment (ACE) Platform is an open source solution that enables agentless threat hunting in an environment (SIEM not included). This tool makes it possible for anyone to begin gathering otherwise difficult to collect host data to hunt for threats in their environment.

As consultants performing Compromise Assessments, we rarely have the authority or ability to alter a customer's environment to support assessment operations. Actions like enabling Windows Remote Management (WinRM) can require levels of bureaucracy and take months to accomplish. It is also difficult to answer questions surrounding systems running OSX and Linux. By removing a few of our assumptions, we created ACE, an ASP.NET Web Application that not only allows the scanning of Windows, Linux, and MacOS machines, but also provides scan management with features like Scheduling, Credential Management, and File Downloading.

In addition to running scripts and collecting scan data, ACE provides a robust enrichment and ingestion pipeline. Users can easily create individual enrichments in ACE to integrate their favorite data sources, such as hash lookups, IP reputation, sandboxing. The enrichment details can be integrated with original results to create the finalized data types in one object. With a final enrichment, the robust data set can be sent directly to a waiting SIEM for analysis. ACE provides an easy and customizable solution for threat hunters to gather and enrich data before it ever reaches the SIEM, enabling more advanced analysis.


### [AVCLASS++: Yet Another Massive Malware Labeling Tool](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection-gray)  
Addressing malware threats requires constant efforts to create and maintain a dataset. Especially, labeling malware samples is a vital part of shepherding a dataset. AVCLASS, a tool which takes as input VirusTotal reports and returns labels that aggregates scan results of multiple anti-viruses, is one of the most well-used oracles in both academia and industry.

However, AVCLASS often suffers from the following drawbacks. First, AVCLASS is prone to fail labeling samples that have just been posted to VirusTotal because only a few anti-viruses give labels to such samples. An inconvenient truth: when we provided AVCLASS with 20,000 VirusTotal reports, half of them could not be labeled. Second, AVCLASS cannot determine if the label is randomly generated (as with domain generation algorithms of malware) or not. Some anti-viruses that VirusTotal has worked with after AVCLASS released were labeled with the DGA, resulting in a biased label. Because of them, we are forced to make a lot of manual, tedious intervention in malware labeling (otherwise, we need to drop samples with inconsistent labels from the dataset).

In this session, we present AVCLASS++, an open-source successor of AVCLASS. AVCLASS++ is carefully designed to address these drawbacks by arming with label propagation and DGA detection. We shall describe these techniques and demonstrate that AVCLASS++ can perform labeling more accurately than the vanilla one. Users of the vanilla AVCLASS can use AVCLASS ++ with the almost same command-line options as before. Even if you have never used AVCLASS, the use of AVCLASS++ is quite easy -- just prepare a malware sample and VirusTotal report, and give them as arguments. We envision that AVCLASS++ supports both practitioners (such as SOC operators, CSIRT members, and malware analysts) and academic researchers, and thus contributes to the further development of prompt security operation and reproducible security research.

This tool delivers a more effective way to APT hunt and IR, and make it even easier to discover un-attributed attacks. Our goal is below:

Find evidence of any phase in cyber attack lifecycle based on the large amount of event logs.
Help to recover the probable ways of intrusion.
We'd like to view APT threat in its whole lifecycle, not just malware, tools and infrastructures.

The next step was to do some research on APT threat hunting, based on incident data analyzing. Our basic concept uses some widely known and classic theory, like ATT&CK and Threat Intelligence. We then tried more practical ways of processing and analyzing incident data and built our own model. The core of this topic will teach you how we standardized data and filtered abnormal behavior, and three major analysis model in our practice, Time-line analysis, Graphic analysis, Statistic analysis. Finally, we will show the practiced cases on some APT group and post-exploitation tools.

![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection-gray)  
Various approaches have been developed through the years for malware analysis and vary from static, dynamic, behavioral, network, memory, and automated. Each analyst has developed his/her own strategy when analyzing malware. However, the accuracy of the results relies densely on their knowledge of system internals, analytical skills, and even reverse engineering. Therefore, novice analysts generate a strict dependency on experienced people to ensure the proper delivery of threat reports.

Even experienced analysts and reverse engineers could miss critical details, such as unexplored code paths, a specific or new self-defense mechanism, a challenging obfuscation algorithm difficult to decipher quickly, or hidden data that was not revealed in early stages. All of this is due to time constraints or a potential lack of information tracking throughout the analysis process.

BLACKPHENIX performs an Intelligent Automation and Analysis by combining all the known malware analysis approaches, automating the time-consuming stages and counter-attacking malware behavioral patterns. The objective: generate precise IOCs by revealing the real malware purpose and exposing its hidden data and related functionalities that are used to exfiltrate or compromise the user's information.

This framework focuses on consolidating, correlating, and cross-referencing the data collected between analysis stages by the execution of Python scripts and helper modules, providing full synchronization between the debugger, disassembler, and supporting components. The automation modules allow interaction with external tools and libraries that can be used to scale the framework functionality by developing plug-ins on top of it, allowing people of any skill level adapt it to their needs and producing actionable threat information in the shape of technical threat reports, IPS/AV signatures or the discovery of new malware attacks, variants or families.

In the arms race between botmasters and defenders, the botmasters have the upper hand, as defenders have to react to actions and novel threats introduced by botmasters. The Botnet Simulation Framework (BSF) addresses this problem by leveling the playing field. It allows defenders to get ahead in the arms race by developing and evaluating new botnet monitoring techniques and countermeasures. This is crucial, as experimenting in the wild will interfere with other researchers and possibly alert botmasters.

BSF allows realistic simulation of peer-to-peer botnets to explore and study the design and impact of monitoring mechanisms and takedown attempts before being deployed in the wild. BSF is a discrete event botnet simulator that provides a set of highly configurable (and customizable) botnet features including:
- realistic churn behavior
- variable bot behavior
- monitoring mechanisms (crawlers and sensors)
- anti-monitoring mechanisms

Moreover, BSF provides an interactive visualization module to further study the outcome of a simulation. BSF is aimed at enabling researchers and defenders to study the design of the different monitoring mechanisms in the presence of anti-monitoring mechanisms [1,2,3]. Furthermore, this tool allows the users to explore and understand the impact of design choices of botnets seen to date.

Nowadays, cloud infrastructure is pretty much the de-facto service used by large/small companies. Most of the major organizations have entirely moved to cloud. With more and more companies moving to cloud, the security of cloud becomes a major concern.

While AWS, GCP, Azure, and DigitalOcean provide you protection with traditional security methodologies and have a neat structure for authorization/configuration, their security is as robust as the person in-charge of creating/assigning these configuration/policies. Also, the massive scale at which cloud services are adopted in enterprises, merged with inevitability of human error, often leads to catastrophic damages to the business.

Few vulnerable scenarios:
- Security groups/policies, password policy or IAM policies are not configured adequately
- S3 buckets and Azure blobs are world-readable
- Web servers are supporting vulnerable SSL ciphers
- Ports exposed to public with vulnerable services running
- If root credentials are used
- Logging or MFA is disabled
And many more such scenarios...

Knowing all this, audit of cloud infrastructure becomes a hectic task! There are a few open source tools which help in cloud auditing however none of them provides an exhaustive checklist. Also, setting up all the tools and looking at different result sets is a redundant task. While managing massive infrastructures, system audit of server instances is a challenging task as well.

Cloud Security Suite (CS Suite) is a one stop tool for auditing the security posture of the AWS/GCP/Azure/DigitalOcean infrastructures along with server audit feature. CS Suite leverages capabilities of current open source tools and has plethora of custom checks into one tool to rule them all.

![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection-gray)  
Nowadays, cloud infrastructure is pretty much the de-facto service used by large/small companies. Most of the major organizations have entirely moved to cloud. With more and more companies moving to cloud, the security of cloud becomes a major concern.

While AWS, GCP & Azure provide you protection with traditional security methodologies and have a neat structure for authorization/configuration, their security is as robust as the person in-charge of creating/assigning these configuration/policies. Also, the massive scale at which cloud services are adopted in enterprises, merged with inevitability of human error, often leads to catastrophic damages to the business.

Few vulnerable scenarios:

Security groups/policies, password policy or IAM policies are not configured adequately
S3 buckets and Azure blobs are world-readable
Web servers are supporting vulnerable SSL ciphers
Ports exposed to public with vulnerable services running
If root credentials are used
Logging or MFA is disabled
And many more such scenarios...

Knowing all this, audit of cloud infrastructure becomes a hectic task! There are a few open source tools which help in cloud auditing however none of them provides an exhaustive checklist. Also, setting up all the tools and looking at different result sets is a redundant task. While managing massive infrastructures, system audit of server instances is a challenging task as well.

CS Suite is a one stop tool for auditing the security posture of the AWS/GCP/Azure infrastructures along with server audit feature. CS Suite leverages capabilities of current open source tools and has plethora of custom checks into one tool to rule them all.


### [Cloud Sniper](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection-gray)  
Cloud Sniper is a platform designed to manage Cloud Security Operations, intended to respond to security incidents by accurately analyzing and correlating cloud artifacts. It is meant to be used as a Cloud Security Operations platform to detect and remediate security incidents by showing a complete visibility of the company's cloud security posture.

It introduces a centralized Incident and Response platform, which executes automatic actions, by learning from the analysts' expert knowledge. To do it, only native cloud artifacts and open source technologies are implemented. In this way, the community can extend the project with different security use cases.

Cloud Sniper receives and processes security feeds, providing an automatic response mechanism to protect the cloud infrastructure. To detect attackers' advanced TTPs, Cloud Sniper Analytics module correlates IOCs providing enhanced security findings to the security analyst.

With this platform, you get a complete and comprehensive management system of the security incidents. At the same time, an advanced security analyst can integrate Cloud Sniper with external forensic or incident-and-response tools to ingest new security feeds. The platform automatically deploys and provides cloud-based integration with all native resources, in a fully modularized manner, making it very easy to extend for the community.

Cloud Sniper introduces an analytics module to analyze data, metrics and telemetry generated on the cloud. This first version analyzes VPC flows to detect beaconing patterns.

As part of the platform, we have developed two modules to complement it:

* Cloud Droid (Incident and Response Simulations): Currently, incident and response teams develop different mechanisms to detect attacks, leaving aside the testing phase. Although each automation is tested before implementation, it is not constantly monitored. Droid proposes an automated testing model in which controlled actions are expected to be triggered to perform security incident simulations.

* Cloud Lusat (Internal Threat Intelligence Feeds, Inventory and Compliance Data Collection): It aims to process information based on threat intelligence feeds, generate an inventory and check the compliance of different cloud resources.


### [CornerShot: Gaining Foresight in Restrictive Networks](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection-gray)  
Legacy internal networks are usually flat, simple for a red team to cut through, and difficult for blue teams to defend. To fix this problem, modern networks apply zero trust access and network segmentation. This new paradigm presents new challenges not only to attackers but to defenders as well.

In such environments, visibility becomes crucial. Which computers can access others and be viable candidates for lateral movement? This question is certainly troubling attackers and red teams, but also defenders and blue teams looking to identify and defend such key network paths.

CornerShot utilized a novel technique to discover network access between two remote hosts, without requiring privileged access to those hosts. In modern warfare CornerShot is a weapon that allows a soldier to look past a corner (and possibly take a shot), without actually risking exposure. Similarly, the CornerShot capability allows one to look at another hosts' network access non-intrusively, without risking exposure.

CornerShot relies on several, well documented, standard Remote Procedure Call (RPC) methods that are used by various Microsoft services. By using methods that only require a non-privileged authenticated account in the domain, CornerShot is able to trigger network traffic from a destination host to a target. Once traffic is generated, CornerShot is able to determine the remote's port state by measuring the time an RPC call took, and the response it received from the destination host.

We will demonstrate real world applications, for example: how to scan an entire network access from a single deployment of CornerShot, and how to validate which BloodHound paths are practical given the underlying network access.

### [CyBot: Open-Source Threat Intelligence Chat Bot (Platform Enhanced)](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection-gray)  
Threat intelligence chat bots are useful friends. They perform research for you and can even be note takers or central aggregators of information. However, it seems like most organizations want to design their own bot in isolation and keep it internal. To counter this trend, our goal was to create a repeatable process using a completely free open source framework, an inexpensive Raspberry Pi (or even virtual machine), and host a community-driven plugin framework to open up the world of threat intel chat bots to everyone from the average home user to the largest security operations center.

We were thrilled to debut the end result of our research (a chat bot that we affectionately call CyBot) at Black Hat Arsenal Vegas 2017. To build on that momentum we also brought CyBot to Black Hat Europe and Asia to gather more great feedback and ideas from an enthusiastic international crowd. This year's Black Hat Vegas will allow us to share new features that stemmed from Black Hat feedback as well as enhancements provided by a platform upgrade.

Best of all, if you know even a little bit of Python, you can help our global collaboration efforts by writing plugins and sharing them with the community. If you want to build your own CyBot, the instructions in this project will let you do so with about an hour of invested time and anywhere from $0-$35 in expenses. Come make your own threat intelligence chat bot today!


### [DARWIN: Real World Use Cases for Covert Wireless](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection-gray)  
DARWIN is a result of an evolution of our covert channel research, where we considered use case of covert channel to facilitate an unmanaged chat in the local radio periphery. DARWIN can be divided into three parts viz., 1. Scripts for covert traffic 2. Mechanism to consume and push the data on terminal (presently we are considering terminal for input and output of the chat messages) 3. Integration (to consume the input from terminal and fit it into the requisite location in IEEE 802.11/IEEE 802.15.4 data link layer frame to ship it over the air and vice versa).


### [Deep Information Retrieval for Malware Searching System](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection-gray)  
More than 300,000 new malware samples are generated everyday, and it is well known that traditional malware detection based on file hash and rules is very vulnerable to variants. It is also getting harder to categorize unknown malware samples because the cost of finding similar samples is increasing. Therefore, the necessity of malware information retrieval system has emerged. Several attempts have been researched to perform this task, but they have limitations in terms of polymorphism, complexity, ambiguity, novelty and so on.

This research seeks to remedy these problems by introducing a deep metric learning method and proposes a new malware retrieval system which has learned a semantic similarities of malware samples. This system could retrieve information from perceptually similar samples as well as structurally similar samples. It could deal with new samples rapidly and roles as a good feature extractor for another tasks like malware classification or categorization. This approach can be easily adapted to other neural network models because it doesn't change the structure of the original network.

In this presentation, we describe the problems that arise when creating a malware retrieval system, and how we solve them. Also we visualize the embedding vectors of malware samples and show the retrieval results to prove the synchronization between our perception on malware and embedding space.


### [Defending software development ecosystems with Safe Package](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection-gray)  
With typosquatting, with account takeover, and with dependency hijacking attackers are using malicious packages to target our deployment pipelines. They mimic popular packages like Material Tailwind, hijack popular dependencies like event-stream, and compromise privileged accounts. This talk explains these classes of attack with examples and introduces safe-package, an open-source security wrapper for all kinds of package managers that neutralizes these attacks.


### [DejaVu ++](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection-gray)  
DejaVu is an open source deception framework which can be used to deploy decoys across the infrastructure. This could be used by the defender to deploy multiple interactive (Server and Client) decoys strategically across the network and cloud.

We have done massive updates to our platform (now DejaVu ++) and are excited to present these at Blackhat Europe. Some key updates:

1. Decentralized architecture to support enterprise orgs
2. Video recording of attacker's movement, record attacker's activity
3. Highly interactive decoys to engage the attacker and reveal attacker motivation and TTP
4. Integrated IDS for enriched alerts

### [DejaVu: An Open Source Deception Framework](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection-gray)  
Deception techniques - if deployed well - can be very effective for organizations to improve network defense and can be a useful arsenal for blue teams to detect attacks at very early stage of cyber kill chain. But the challenge we have seen is deploying, managing and administering decoys across large networks is still not easy and becomes complex for defenders to manage this over time. Although there are a lot of commercial tools in this space, we haven't come across open source tools which can achieve this.

With this in mind, we have developed DejaVu which is an open source deception framework which can be used to deploy across the infrastructure. This could be used by the defender to deploy multiple interactive decoys (HTTP Servers, SQL, SMB, FTP, SSH, client side – NBNS) strategically across their network on different VLAN's. To ease the management of decoys, we have built a web-based platform which can be used to deploy, administer and configure all the decoys effectively from a centralized console. Logging and alerting dashboard displays detailed information about the alerts generated and can be further configured on how these alerts should be handled. If certain IP's like in-house vulnerability scanner, SCCM etc. needs to be whitelisted, this can be configured which effectively would mean very few false positives.

Alerts only occur when an adversary is engaged with the decoy, so now when the attacker touches the decoy during reconnaissance or performs authentication attempts this raises a high accuracy alert which should be investigated by the defense. Decoys can also be placed on the client VLAN's to detect client side attacks such as responder/LLMNR attacks using client side decoys. Additionally, common attacks which the adversary uses to compromise such as abusing Tomcat/SQL server for initial foothold can be deployed as decoys, luring the attacker and enabling detection.


### [Detecting Linux Kernel Rootkits with Tracee](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection-gray)  
Linux Kernel Rootkits is an advanced and fascinating topic in cyber security. These tools are stealthy and evasive by design and often target the lower levels of the OS, unfortunately, there aren't many solid security tools that can provide extensive visibility to detect these kinds of tools.

Tracee is a Runtime Security and forensics tool for Linux, utilizing eBPF technology to trace systems and applications at runtime, analyze collected events to detect suspicious behavioral patterns and capture forensics artifacts.

Tracee was presented in BH EU 2020 and BH USA 2021. Thus far we have presented Tracee-ebpf and spoken about its passive capabilities to collect OS events based on given filters, and Tracee-rules, which is the runtime security detection engine. But Tracee has another capability to safely interact with the Linux kernel, which grants Tracee even more superpowers.

Tracee was designed to provide observability of events in running containers. It was released in 2019 as an OSS project, allowing practitioners and researchers to benefit from its capabilities. Now, Tracee has greatly evolved, adding more robust and advanced capabilities. Tracee is a runtime security and forensics tool for Linux, built to address common Linux security issues.

### [Detecting Typo-Squatting, Backdoored, Abandoned, and Other "Risky" Open-Source Packages Using Packj](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection-gray)  
Software supply chain attacks on open-source software ecosystems, particularly on popular package managers such as NPM, PyPI have increased tremendously in the last few years. Today, developers must thoroughly analyze packages, and avoid risky packages that may expose them to high levels of supply chain risks.

But, there exists no tool to measure supply chain risks lurking in open-source packages. Current practices include sourcing only mature, stable, popular, and reputable packages, where such attributes are inferred from publicly available metrics, such as GitHub stars, package downloads, and software development activity. However, such vanity metrics do not reveal true information about the security posture of packages. More importantly, an attacker-controlled bot can easily manipulate such metrics. Manually vetting hundreds of dependencies is infeasible.

In this talk, we will present our open-source command line vetting tool, called Packj that allows developers to easily analyze dependencies for "risky" code/attributes and provide actionable insights into their security posture. In this presentation, we will cover the technical details of our tool and discuss its usage. Packj tool powers also our large-scale security vetting infrastructure that continuously analyzes millions of published packages, and provides detailed risk assessment reports. We have already detected a number of abandoned, typo-squatting, and malicious packages. We will present our findings, highlight different types of attack techniques adopted by bad actors, and discuss measures that developers can take to thwart such attacks. With our work, we hope to enhance productivity of the developer community by exposing undesired behavior in untrusted third-party code, maintaining developer trust and reputation, and enforcing security of package managers.


### [Dissect: The Open-Source Framework for Large-Scale Host Investigations](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection-gray)  
Dissect is an incident response framework build from various parsers and implementations of file formats. Tying this all together, Dissect allows you to work with tools named target-query and target-shell to quickly gain access to forensic artefacts, such as Runkeys, Prefetch files, and Windows Event Logs, just to name a few!

And the best thing: all in a singular way, regardless of underlying container (E01, VMDK, QCoW), filesystem (NTFS, ExtFS, FFS), or Operating System (Windows, Linux, ESXi) structure / combination. You no longer have to bother extracting files from your forensic container, mount them (in case of VMDKs and such), retrieve the MFT, and parse it using a separate tool, to finally create a timeline to analyse. This is all handled under the hood by Dissect in a user-friendly manner.

This way you spend less time with the boring processing steps and have more time doing actual analysis or research!


### [DotDumper: automatically unpacking DotNet based malware](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection-gray)  
Analysts at corporations of any size face an ever-increasing amount of DotNet based malware. The malware comes in all shapes and forms, ranging from skittish stealers all the way to nation-state-backed targeted malware. The underground market, along with public open-source tools, provides a plethora of ways to obfuscate and pack the malware. Unpacking malware is time-consuming, difficult, and tedious, which poses a problem.

To counter this, DotDumper automatically dumps interesting artifacts during the malware's execution, ranging from base64 decoded values to decrypted PE files. As such, the malware decrypts and executes the next stage, while DotDumper conveniently provides a copy of said decrypted stage. All this is done via a simple, compact, intuitive, and easy-to-use command-line interface.

Aside from the dumped artifacts, DotDumper provides an extensive log of the traced execution, based on managed hooks. For each hook, the log contains the original function name, arguments and their values, and the return value. Since DotDumper ensures that the original function is called, the malware's execution continues as if it was executed normally, allowing the analyst to get as many stages from the sample as possible.

DotDumper can execute DotNet Framework executables, as well as dynamic link libraries, due to the fully-fledged reflective loader which is embedded. Any given function can be selected within a library, along with any required variables and their values, all easily accessible from DotDumper's command-line interface.

DotDumper has proven to be effective in dealing with the renowned AgentTesla stealer or the WhisperGate Wiper loader, allowing an analyst to easily fetch the decrypted and unpacked in-memory only stages, thus decreasing the time spent on unpacking, allowing for a faster response to the given threat.


### [Drosera: Using Wireless Honeypot to Protect Wireless Networks](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection-gray)  
Drosera is a wireless honeypot platform for discovering wireless intrusion attacks and intruders identification.

In wireless attacks, hackers are often attacking vulnerable wireless hotspots as a breakthrough. This means that a wireless network with obvious flaws will be the primary target for an attacker. When an attacker targets our wireless honeypot network, Drosera will record all actions before and after the attacker connects the network, including the process of attempting to connect to the network at the 802.11 frame level and further attacks after entering the honeypot network. Drosera can accurately identify the attack, and the first time to generate an alarm.

We are equipped with high-interactive Windows and Linux honeypots in the network, which simulate normal business systems to confuse the attacker and delay the attack process. They will also help us get information about the hacker like the goals, the attack methods, and the skill level.


### [EGRESSION](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection-gray)  
Egression is an enterprise traffic egress control testing and ranking system. It is a command-line tool that checks an organization's ability to restrict outbound uploads of sensitive data (a file containing fake CC numbers, SSNs, National ID numbers, addresses, names, and other PII) using increasingly difficult levels (which use increasingly evasive techniques), and then provides the rating for the given organization based on how difficult it was to egress the data from the network.


### [EKTotal](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection-gray)  
"EKTotal" is an integrated analysis tool that can automatically analyze the traffic of Drive-by Download attacks. The proposed software package can identify four types of Exploit Kits such as RIG and Magnitude, and more than ten types of attack campaigns such as Seamless and Fobos. EKTotal can also extract exploit codes and malware. The proposed heuristic analysis engine is based on Exploit Kit tracking research conducted since 2017, and is known as team "nao_sec". EKTotal provides a user-friendly web interface and powerful automated analysis functions. Thus, EKTotal can assist SOC operators and CSIRT members and researchers.

Drive-by download attacks are still actively conducted. Such attacks are continually changing and becoming more complex. At the beginning of 2017, attack campaigns targeting compromised websites were widespread. However, majority of the current attack campaigns are based on malvertising. Furthermore, in March 2018, several Exploit Kits began to exploit the critical vulnerability named CVE-2018-4878, which in turn is a significant threat. Various tools are available for analyzing malicious traffic. However, it's necessary to employ a combination of such tools or possess their knowledge for analyzing malicious traffic. Hence, EKTotal has been developed for conducting security analysis in a simplified manner.

EKTotal is an all-in-one malicious traffic analysis and processing tool that functions by submitting files of "pcap" or "saz" format. After identifying the attack campaign and associated Exploit Kit through multiple filters, EKTotal extracts the obfuscated exploit code from the traffic data, deobfuscates it, and decrypts the encrypted malware. For example, in the case of RIG Exploit Kit, EKTotal deobfuscates multiple obfuscated JavaScript codes, extracts all exploit codes and malware decryption keys, and thereby decrypts the malware encrypted with RC4.

### [FalconEye: Windows Process Injection Techniques - Catch Them All](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection-gray)  
Process injection (PI) in Windows has been a well-known security topic for many years. It is used to gain more stealth because it does not create additional processes in the system that could attract unwanted attention from the defender. It is also used to bypass security products that have limited visibility into the injection behaviors. Since PI techniques use legitimate windows APIs, detecting them becomes a challenging task.

FalconEye provides comprehensive detection for true PI techniques in real-time. True PIs inject into target processes which are already running. Pre-execution injections such as AppInit and process hollowing are not in scope. To the best of our knowledge, we analyzed all the publicly known PI techniques and our tool is able to detect all of them without false positives during our testing.

We identify PI behavior invariants that are unique compared to benign program behaviors but are common between various PI techniques. Based on the behavior invariants, we divide PI detections into three classes:
(1) Stateless detection
(2) Stateful detection
(3) Floating code detection

We propose a comprehensive detection algorithm to detect these behavior invariants classes. Our detection algorithm relies on two instrumentation primitives:
(1) System call interception
(2) Kernel callbacks

Based on our testing, the detection is compatible with Windows 10 1903 and previous versions. Evaluation results show that the detection is effective and has low overhead. Additionally, the generic detection mechanisms are also proven to detect newer PI techniques.

### [FalconHound, automatic attack path detection and enrichment for blue teams](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection-gray)  
For a long time, BloodHound has been the go-to tool for many red teams to uncover possible lateral movement paths in an environment. Fortunately, there are blue teams that also use it to great value. However, there are a lot of teams that struggle to use it due to lack of time or knowledge. On top of that, keeping the information in the BloodHound database up-to-date and using it for automatic detection and enrichment is often not implemented.

Introducing FalconHound, a toolkit that integrates with Microsoft Sentinel, Defender for Endpoint, the Azure Graph API, Neo4j and the BloodHound API to get the most out of your data. Some of its features allow it to track sessions, changes to the environment, alerts, and incidents on your entities and much, much more. All in near-real time!

This additional bi-directional context allows you to make better decisions and focus on the most important alerts and incidents. Allowing you, for instance, to run new path calculations frequently based on modifications, sessions or alerts and respond to these attacks which are very hard to detect without this information.

Our tool is to forecast undetected ATT&CK techniques based on collaborative filtering and graph databases.
PCs and servers are generating massive logs daily, on the other hand, SOCs analysts are required to detect and respond quickly to cyber-attacks. However, it will take a lot of time to detect cyber-attacks if SOC analysts do not have clues. Conventional log analysis tools such as SIEM can detect attacks but cannot predict the next attack from the information already obtained. Recommendation systems often used in e-commerce sites can predict future purchasing behavior by analyzing the user's purchase history. Replacing with ATT&CK, each attacker group can be considered a user, and techniques attackers use can be regarded as a user's purchase history.
Using this tool, the logs are mapped to ATT&CK techniques by uploading log files to create a technique usage history of the attacker (adversary) currently conducting an ongoing attack. The adversary's technique usage history and past APT attack data are used for collaborative filtering to predict which techniques the adversary may use in the future. This visualization is　displayed together with the ATT&CK tactic, enabling you to see the attack flow in stages of progression. In addition, search queries of SIEM associated with forecasted ATT&CK technique are outputted. SOC analysts can consider attacks quickly and comprehensively by using queries.
The source code of this tool and an example analysis will be shown on GitHub. It is available as a web application.

### [Honeyscanner: a vulnerability analyzer for Honeypots](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection-gray)  
Honeypots are now considered a well-studied cyber-deception mechanism that can assist in defending networks as well as identifying new attack trends. However, recent research has shown that honeypots may also be vulnerable to attacks; especially fingerprinting identification ones. Moreover, many open-source honeypots lack an external security analysis and are often deployed with their default settings.

We present honeyscanner, an open-source vulnerability analyzer for honeypots. It is designed to automatically attack a given honeypot, to determine if the honeypot is vulnerable to specific types of cyber-attacks. The analyzer uses a variety of attacks, ranging from identifying vulnerable software libraries to DoS, and fuzzing attacks. In the end, an evaluation report is provided to the honeypot administrator, including advice on how to enhance the security of the honeypot.

HosTaGe is a lightweight, low-interaction, and portable honeypot for mobile devices that aims on the detection of malicious network environments. As most malware propagate over the network via specific protocols, a low-interaction honeypot located at a mobile device can check wireless networks for actively propagating malware. HosTaGe supports many commonly used protocols (e.g. HTTP, TELNET, SSH) along with many IoT/ICS specific ones (e.g. MQTT, S7COMM, MODBUS). We envision such honeypots running on all kinds of mobile devices to provide a quick assessment on the potential security state of a network.

### [Identity Threat Hunting with Kestrel](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection-gray)  
Attacks on Identity and access systems are starting points for major data breaches achieved through privilege escalation and lateral movement. Identity-threat hunting reduces time needed to detect traces of an attacker so that the consequences of a breach can be controlled. Identity-threat hunting involves data collection from identity providers, normalization and application of analytics while navigating the rabbit holes of authentication flows across the systems. Kestrel is a threat hunting language that accelerates cyber threat hunting by providing a layer of abstraction to build reusable, composable, and shareable "hunt-flows", providing a great platform for identity-threat hunting.


This arsenal session will showcase identity-threat hunting built on top of Kestrel. Starting with federated data retrieval from IAM systems using the OASIS Structured Threat Information eXpression (STIX) standard via OCA's STIX-shifter and lifting the results into an entity-relational data model. Then we will showcase analytic hunt steps besides data retrieval steps, walking you through the use case to hunt malicious activity in login data.


To showcase the capability of kestrel and identity threat hunting, we use event data gathered from IBM Security Verify Identity and access management (IAM). The queries and analysis follow OASIS STIX standards. Our hunt book will work with any Identity provider that has a stix-shifter connector.


The showcase uses a search for the IP address with multiple failed logins and later drills down and correlates with threat intel of known malicious activity for those IP addresses. The demo will also showcase the geographical distribution of those suspicious IP addresses, a list of applications which are accessed by these compromised IP addresses and accounts details of the logged-in user by IP address.


Making it ready to try by the audience, we will demonstrate live hunts in Jupyter Notebooks. At the end of the session, we will introduce the kestrel-huntbook repo for people to reuse existing huntbooks and share their hunting knowledge with their colleagues and other hunters in the community

Have you ever wondered how many ways there are to detect a defacement attack?

- Based on hash
- Based on signature
- Differential comparison
- Machine learning

Well, quite a lot. Nowadays, machine learning have really developed, with increasing agility and accuracy, this is
a new approach in Cyber Security in general which can adapt to new attack techniques.

In this talk, we will be presenting In0ri - a defacement detection system utilizing image-classification convolutional neural network.
There's two ways to deploy and use In0ri:
- Running off crontab by periodically visiting the URL.
- Internal agent running off the web server

With the first method, we can directly check if a path has been defaced or not.
As a system administrator, we can use the second method to check a local website with an internal Agent.

In0ri the first source machine learning project to detect defacement attacks, we will show the process of installing, training and running In0ri. After that, we will show how it succeeds to get high quality of detecting the deface attacks by using deep learning.

We will also be explaining the reason behind In0ri's high accuracy when classifying defacement attacks.


### [KSBox: A Fine-Grained macOS Malware Sandbox](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection-gray)  
Last year I published the Kemon open source project, which included a Pre and Post callback-based kernel inline hook engine. By using this engine, we can easily implement IPC and XPC monitoring, which helps build a fine-grained macOS malware sandbox. Therefore, there will be a new useful tool in our arsenal in August: KSBox.

Currently, KSBox malware sandbox has the following features: process and file operation monitoring; macOS IPC, XPC and network traffic monitoring; dynamic library and kernel extension monitoring; Mandatory Access Control (MAC) policy monitoring and filtering, etc. In short, security analysts can use this project to better analyze and gain insight into macOS malware.


### [Kemon: An Open-Source Pre and Post Callback-Based Framework for macOS Kernel Monitoring](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection-gray)  
If third-party vendors want to add new features to the macOS kernel, such as antivirus capabilities, ransomware blocking, data breach auditing, behavior monitoring and so on, they usually need the support of the system's exported interfaces. At present, only two known official interfaces are available, they are Kernel Authorization subsystem and Mandatory Access Control framework. Unfortunately, neither of them are suitable for today's kernel development tasks. The Kernel Authorization KPIs was designed thirteen years ago and it is clear that it lacks the necessary maintenance and upgrades. For example, there are only seven file operation related notification callbacks available, which are obviously not enough. For each notification callback (KAUTH_SCOPE_FILEOP), we cannot modify the return results. For some specific callback functions, the input parameters lack critical context information. As for the Mandatory Access Control framework, Apple directly claims that third parties should not use these private interfaces, this mechanism is not part of the KPI.

In order to bring about some changes, I'd like to introduce you to Kemon, an open source Pre and Post-operation based kernel callback framework. With the power of Kemon, we can easily implement LPC communication monitoring, MAC policy filtering, kernel driver firewall, etc. In general, from an attacker's perspective, this framework can help achieve more powerful Rootkit. From the perspective of defense, Kemon can help construct more granular monitoring capabilities. I also implemented a kernel fuzzer through this framework, which helped me find many vulnerabilities, such as: CVE-2017-7155, CVE-2017-7163, CVE-2017-13883, etc.

### [LATMA - lateral movement analyzer](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection-gray)  
LATMA is a tool for offline detection and investigation of lateral movement attack based on AD event logs. The tool assists security teams to overcome the main challenges:

Data collection and preparation: in theory, event logs are an available data source to look for authentication anomalies. In practice, however, the source and destination machines are not represented in the same manner (hostname vs. IP), which prevents the ability to directly detect movement of a user account across different machines. LATMA conforms the representation of the source and destination machines, making the even log ready for analysis which is the tool's primary objectives.

Data analysis: LATMA scans the even data, looking for authentication patterns we have learned to be associated with lateral movement. For example, a chain of authentications where a single account logs from machine A to machine B and consecutively from machine B to C. Another example is what we call White-Cane in which an account logs from a single source to multiple destinations one after the other. The patterns LATMA searches for are based on our analysis of attacks in the wild, as well as on novel detection algorithm we have developed.

LATMA can be used in any environment where Kerberos and NTLM auditing is enabled, making it an easy and useful tool to any security professionals that handle an Active Directory environment. Offline analysis of authentications, while not real-time, is an efficient method to hunt for active lateral movement that goes under the radar and can provide the means to contain it before it reaches its objectives.

### [LMYN: Let's Map Your Network](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection-gray)  
It is of the utmost importance for any security engineer to understand their network first before securing it and it becomes a daunting task to have a 'true' understanding of a widespread network. In a mid to large level organisation's network having a network architecture diagram doesn't provide the complete understanding and manual verification is a nightmare. Hence in order to secure entire network it is important to have a complete picture of all the systems which are connected to your network.

BOTTOM LINE - YOU CAN'T SECURE WHAT YOU ARE NOT AWARE OF.

Let's Map Your Network (LMYN) aims to provide a easy to use interface to security engineer and network administrator to have their network in graphical form with zero manual error, where a node represents a system and relationship between nodes represent the connection. To achieve this it uses the basic network commands such as traceroute, ping scan etc.

Below are the modules in LMYN to perform the task of mapping

Project Management – Two modules (New Project and Working Project) will allow you to create and switch between the different projects

Load CMDB - This module allows an administrator to upload the CMDB file (new line separated) and map it entirely. Additionally, it have a Be Intrusive feature which, if selected, will perform enumeration to identify the 'rogue' host that are not present in CMDB. RED color node will depicts the rogue nodes

Find Me – This module enumerates the IP of system in which it is running and further network mapping will be done considering the current system as a 'seed'

Roam Around – This module identifies all 'live' hosts in the same LAN in which seed system is connected

Go To – This module displays graph of all hops that packet is traversing through to reach destination (provided by user) from seed system

Scan – This module will perform ping scan of any arbitrary IP range provided by user

What interesting stuff can we find by looking only at URLs without the actual HTTP traffic ?

Well, quite a lot. Hackers often do not reinvent the wheel. They buy existing malwares or phishing that use the same scheme for HTTP communication. Techniques to randomize URLs , like DGA, often apply on the domain part". But what about the rest?

In this talk, we present LUDA - Large URLs Dataset Analyzer for security. It works in two modes: Malware or Phishing.
The first will detect similarities between C2 communication and cluster them by families. The last will apply the same clustering with an additional layer of " brand " detection.
Both of them can automatically extract regexes, using Genetic algorithm, and can be deployed for inline detections.
This powerful tool already supports integration with various public malicious repositories like PhishTank, URLHaus , Virus Total as well as dozens more.
As opposed to similar projects , this tool is focused only on security. It includes specific options like automatic false positive cleaning.
We will demo how we can run LUDA on public datasets with the two modes and show how it succeeds to get quality insights from large datasets. Finally we will show what are the current threat families found on real traffic data taken from Akamai Secure Web Gateway.


### [Learn How to Build Your Own Utility to Monitor Malicious Behaviors of Malware on macOS](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection-gray)  
The landscape of macOS malware has changed dramatically in the past couple of years. Threats are becoming more complex, more varied, and more numerous. As a malware analyst or security researcher, having a powerful dynamic analysis utility is vital to be effective and efficient. This utility can enable us to understand malware capabilities and quickly analyze the malicious behaviors of malware.

Want to know how to build your own arsenal? I will detail the implementation to monitor kinds of malicious behaviors of malware on macOS. The capabilities of the utility cover monitoring process execution with command line arguments, file system events (including all common file operations, such as open, read, write, delete, rename operations), dylib loading event, network activities (including UDP, TCP, ICMP, DNS query and response).

The Mandatory Access Control Framework is the substrate on top of which all of Apple's securities, both macOS and iOS, are implemented. I will discuss how to monitor process execution, file system events, and dylib loading events using MACF on macOS. Next, I'll provide the details for monitoring network activities using Socket Filters. The utility can also record some basic info including process name, parent process name, pid, ppid, uid besides the specific details for each event. For DNS response, this utility can parse the data of DNS response and record the IP:URL mappings.

The utility consists of two parts, one is the KEXT(core component) in kernel, the other one is a client program in user space, which involves the communication between kernel space and user space. After discussing some communication mechanisms, I'll choose the kernel control API, which is a socket-based API that allows you to communicate with and receive broadcast notifications from the KEXT. The client program is intended to receive the data from the KEXT and display it to users.

In this presentation, I provide an advanced solution to monitor kinds of malicious behaviors of malware in kernel on macOS. I will also provide all involved key technical details for the implementation of monitoring all common malicious behaviors of malware on macOS. This utility is designed to dynamically analyze the malicious behaviors of malware on macOS, helping analysts or security researchers more efficiently analyze malware. You can build your own utility for fun!

Malboxes is a tool to streamline and simplify the creation and management of virtual machines used for malware analysis.

Building analysis machines is a tedious task. One must have all the proper tools installed on a VM such as a specific version of vulnerable software (ie: Flash), Sysinternal tools, debuggers (Windbg), network traffic analyzers (Wireshark), man-in-the-middle tools (Fiddler). One must also avoid leaking his precious proprietary software licenses (IDA). At the moment, this menial job is not automated and is repeated by every analyst.

Malboxes leverages the DevOps principle of infrastructure as code to enable researchers to automatically create fully operational and reusable analysis machines. The tool uses Vagrant and Packer to do an initial out-of-band bootstrapping. Afterward, chocolatey is used to install further tools benefiting from the chocolatey package repository.

Attendees will learn a simple tool for safe malware analysis practice that is easy to grasp, enabling them to start doing analysis faster. Seasoned malware researchers will also gain from this demo by seeing how the DevOps approach can be applied to simplify and accelerate their labs' malware reverse-engineering capacity or reduce its management overhead.

### [MLPdf: An Effective Machine Learning Based Approach for PDF Malware Detection](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection-gray)  
Due to the popularity of portable document format (PDF) and increasing number of vulnerabilities in major PDF viewer applications, malware writers continue to use it to deliver malware via web downloads, email attachments and other methods in both targeted and non-targeted attacks. The topic on how to effectively block malicious PDF documents has received huge research interests in both cyber security industry and academia with no sign of slowing down.

In this work, we propose and demonstrate a novel approach based on a multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network model, termed MLPdf, for the detection of PDF based malware. More specifically, the MLPdf model uses a backpropagation algorithm with stochastic gradient decent search for model update. A group of high quality features are extracted from two real-world datasets which comprise around 105000 benign and malicious PDF documents. Evaluation results indicate that the proposed MLPdf approach exhibits excellent performance which significantly outperforms all evaluated eight well known commercial anti-virus scanners with a much higher true positive rate (TPR) of 95.12% achieved while maintaining a very low false positive rate of 0.08%. Of the evaluated commercial AV scanners, the best scanner only has a TPR of 84.53%, which is over 10% lower than the proposed MLPdf model. In the demonstration, we will first manually analyze a malicious PDF document , then show how it can be automatically detected by the proposed ML approach.

### [MLSploit: Resilient ML Platform - Advanced Deep Learning Analytic Platform Made Easy for Every Security Researcher](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection-gray)  
Deep learning (DL) and machine learning (ML) had been proved to be effective tools to analyze or detect malware. To help security experts to apply cutting-edge ML technologies effortlessly, we designed a large scale DL analytic platform uniquely for security researches. This platform has a ML pipeline web interface which can guide users through each pipeline steps. Its novel feature analysis tool enables feature study and manipulation for adversarial ML evasive attack. The performances of classifiers can be compared and optimized and then used for prediction. The RESTful interface of this platform was developed to enable connections between external applications. Also it is possibly to productize this platform to become an cloud service.

Security analyst can upload either static or dynamic malware dataset to storage, i.e. big data Hadoop file system, and start the analysis. Or if backend sandbox is hooded, binaries can be uploaded for processing and then apply the output for inference. The ML pipeline supports several popular open source libraries, such as Scikit-Learn, big data Spark ML and deep learning Keras/Theano/Tensorflow. The slow DL training can be accelerated in a loosely connected backend worker, such as Intel Xeon Phi or GPGPU machines. The outputs are presented at web pages in several tables or in 2-D or 3-D interactive JavaScript diagrams for clear visualization. All the outputs, such as feature coefficient etc., can be downloaded for other usages. Also the prediction page can be used for ensemble inference or extended to be a test bed to demo new algorithm or adversarial attacks and defences. We will demo ransomware analysis on this platform and the perturbation attack against pre-trained image convolution neural network classifiers. We believe via this platform the security researches and analysis can be accelerated greatly.

The growth of internet and users increases exponentially and drastically in this decade that provides services inheriting various benefits to users such as online banking,marketing, buying /selling and various facility management services etc. It attracts some people to develop programs that perform
various malicious activities intentionally or unintentionally such as stealing sensitive informationfrom computer, displaying advertisement, causing harmful, unwanted activities. The malicious software are referred as
malwares. Therefore, this tool helps in detecting, classifying and visualizing the features of malware. Our tool uses the application of Malware Analysis, Machine learning and deep learning algorithms and some general framework applications to automatically classify whether the uploaded file is "Malicious or Legitimate". If it is legitimate the user is free to use but if it is malicious then that uploaded file(malware) is taken for review .It is analyzed and
important features of the malware are represented in graph based network.

![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection-gray)  
Containers are the most popular technology for deploying modern applications. SPOILER ALERT: bypassing well-known security controls is also popular. In this talk, we explain how to use the recent updates in Falco, a CNCF open-source container security tool, to detect drifts and fileless malware in containerized environments.

As a best practice, containers should be considered immutable. Early this year, Falco introduced new features to detect container drift via OverlayFS, which can spot if binaries are added or modified after the container's deployment. New binaries are often a sign of an ongoing attack.

Of course, attackers can also use more advanced evasion techniques to stay hidden. By using in-memory, fileless execution, attackers can bypass most of the security controls such as drift detection and still reach their goals with no stress.

To combat fileless attacks, Falco has also added memfd-based fileless execution thanks to its visibility superpowers on Linux kernel system calls. Combining Falco's existing runtime security capabilities with these two new detection layers forms the foundation of a defense in depth strategy for cloud-native workloads.

We will walk you through real-world scenarios based on recent threats and malware, demoing how Falco can help detect and respond to these malicious behaviors and comparing both drift and fileless attack paths.

In incident response scenarios, intercepting attacks or quarantining backdoors is a common response technique. The adversarial active defense will immediately make the attacker perceive that the intrusion behavior is exposed, and the attacker may try to use defense evasion to avoid subsequent detection. These defense evasion may even result in later attacks going undetected. If we mislead or deceive the attacker into the honeypot, we can better consume the attacker's time cost and gain more response time.

We invented a series of toolkits to deceive attackers during the "kill-chain" . For Example:

Exploitation:
1. We return success and mislead the attacker into the honeypot for brute-force attacks.
2. We will simulate the execution of web attack payloads to achieve the purpose of disguising the existence of vulnerabilities in the system.

Command & Control:
1. For the Webshell scenario, we will replace the Webshell with a proxy and transfer the Webshell to the honeypot. When the attacker accesses Webshell, the proxy will forward his request to the honeypot.
2. For the reverse shell, we will inject the shell process and forward the attacker's operation to the shell process in the honeypot.
3. For the backdoor, we will dump the process's memory, resources, etc., and migrate it to the honeypot to continue execution.

![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection-gray)  
MoP ("Master of Puppets") is an open source framework for reverse engineers who wish to create and operate trackers for new malware found in the wild for research purpose. To make it simple - MoP framework takes care of all the generic malware tracker stuff so the reverse engineer is left with pure reverse engineering work, You only need to implement a simple plugin on top of MoP which describes the malware's network protocol. MoP ships with a variety of workstation simulation capabilities, such as fake filesystem manager and fake process manager, multi-worker orchestration, TOR integration and more, all aiming to deceive adversaries into interacting with our simulated environment and possibly drop new unique samples. Since everything is done in pure python, no virtual machines or Docker containers are needed and no actual malicious code is executed, all of which enables us to scale up in a click of a button, connecting to potentially thousands of different malicious servers at once from a single instance running on a single laptop. MoP framework comes with a number of pre-built plugins for known RATs, such as NjRAT and Gh0stRAT which will be showcased live with real command and control servers!

### [N3XT G3N WAF: ML based WAF with Retraining and Detainment through Honeypots](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection-gray)  
With the explosive growth of web applications since the early 2000s, web-based attacks have progressively become more rampant. One common solution is the Web Application Firewall (WAF). However, tweaking rules of current WAFs to improve the detection mechanisms can be complex and difficult.

NGWAF seeks to address the drawback method mentioned earlier with a novel machine learning and honeypot based architecture.

Firstly, we replace the traditional rulesets with deep learning models to reduce the complexity of managing and updating those rules. Instead of manually identifying rules, we use machine learning to automate the process of learning patterns from previous malicious data. In addition, we include a system model maintenance where we monitor the performance of the model and regularly retrain the model with new malicious data collected. A detection mechanism based on a fully automated machine learning pipeline will greatly reduce the manpower required and potential for error involved in WAF maintenance.

Malicious data detected will then be redirected into our novel system: an interactive, honeypotted, quarantine environment built to isolate potential hostile attackers and act as a sinkhole to gather current attack methods. Unlike conventional WAFs that just drop or block malicious attempts, NGWAF traps and diverts the threat actors to emulated systems to soften the impact of their malicious actions. By detaining the attacker to a series of scalable honeypotted environments, we are able to observe and collect their out-in-the-wild malicious data for future improvements to the detection mechanism. These data are automatically scrubbed and can be batched to be retrained into our detection model.

NGWAF is scalable and can be easily deployed either natively or in a cloud environment.

NFC Scrambler is an android app that emulates a rfid card to prevent nfc skimming. Rfid cards are used nearly everywhere, either in the forms of identification cards or credit cards. RFID Skimming statistics reveal that every two seconds a new case of identity theft is reported in the United States; however, not everyone can afford a rfid blocker card or wallet. Thus this app will help them block rfid skimming for free.

What if we could stop DDOS attacks before they even make it to the Internet? Noddos can block DDOS traffic in the gateway, router or firewall connecting the home- or enterprise network to the Internet. That's the truly scalable way to stop the botnets. Noddos enables that with open source client software, a big-data platform in the cloud and building a community that can sustain identifying botnets and defining the ACLs that can restrict their traffic flows.

### [Network Monitoring Tools for macOS](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection-gray)  
As the majority of malware contains networking capabilities, it is well understood that detecting unauthorized network access is a powerful detection heuristic. However, while the concepts of network traffic analysis and monitoring to detect malicious code are well established and widely implemented on platforms such as Windows, there remains a dearth of such capabilities on macOS.

Here, we will present various tools capable of enumerating network state, statistics, and traffic, directly on a macOS host. We will showcase open-source tools that leverage low-level APIs, private frameworks, and user-mode extensions that provide insight into all networking activity on macOS:

Specifically we'll demonstrate:

* A network monitor that allows one to explore all network sockets and connections, either via an interactive UI, or from the commandline.

* A DNS monitor that uses Apple's Network Extension Framework to monitors DNS requests and responses directly from the Terminal.

* A firewall that monitors and filters all network traffic, giving users with the ability to block unknown/unauthorized outgoing connections.

### [Omniscient: Lets Map Your Network](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection-gray)  
Omniscient: Lets Map Your Network aims to provide an easy-to-use and point-in-time interface to security engineers and network administrators to represent their network in graphical form with zero manual error, where a node represents a system and relationship between nodes represents a direct connection. It also monitors the 'identified' network with user-defined periodicity and provides the analytics on rogue systems/devices present in network.

It is utmost important for any security engineer to understand their network first before securing it and it becomes a daunting task to have a 'true' understanding of a widespread network. In a mid to large level organisation's network having a network architecture diagram doesn't provide the complete understanding of network and manual verification is a nightmare. Hence in order to secure entire network it is important to have a complete picture of all the systems which are connected to your network, irrespective of their type, function, technology etc.

BOTTOM LINE - YOU CAN'T SECURE WHAT YOU ARE NOT AWARE OF.

Omniscient does it in two phases:
1. Learning: In this phase, Omniscient 'learns' the network by utilising passive network enumeration, active scans and upload of existing CMDB for on-premises network; and by querying the APIs for cloud networks. Then it builds graph database leveraging the responses of all learning activities. User can perform any of the learning activities at any point of time and Omniscient will incorporate the results in existing database.

2. Monitoring: This is a continuous and automatic process, where Omniscient monitors the 'identified' network (with user-defined periodicity) for any changes, compare it with existing information and update the graph database accordingly.


### [Out-Of-Band Anti Virus Dock (OOBAVD) - A Hardware & Artificial Intelligence Based Anti Virus Solution](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection-gray)  
USB-based attacks account for more than 52% of all cybersecurity attacks on operational technology (OT) systems in the industrial control systems (ICS) industry. The discovery of Stuxnet in 2015 served as a stark reminder that even air-gapped computers, previously thought to be impervious to cyberattacks, are vulnerable. These systems are found in secure military organizations or Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems. The societal impact of such attacks can be enormous. Stuxnet, for example, caused significant damage to Iran's nuclear programs and facilities.

While air-gapped systems are considered "secure," they are inconvenient for computer operators, particularly when performing updates and transferring data, which require the use of mobile storage devices, such as USB sticks. Unfortunately, this introduces a flaw into the air-gapped systems, exposing them to computer viruses and malware. Furthermore, adding new peripherals to these systems, such as keyboards and mice, allows BadUSB attacks to be carried out.

OOBAVD is a solution to close this gap. OOBAVD acts as a intermediary between the air-gapped system and USB devices, scanning and blocking detected malicious files from the air-gapped system. Furthermore, malware can attack commercial software-based antivirus software on the host machine by blocking, corrupting, and replacing core antivirus engine files, rendering them inoperable and defenseless. OOBAVD being out of band in the transfer process, is mitigated from this risk.

OOBAVD is designed to have minimum software pre-installed, which reduces the attack surface area to be infected by malware. OOBAVD can also be wiped clean and flashed before connecting to new air-gapped computers, removing persistent malware that manages to infect OOBAVD.


### [PA Toolkit: Wireshark Plugins for Pentesters](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection-gray)  
Wireshark is the most basic tool that anyone thinks of when network traffic analysis is mentioned. Wireshark is beyond doubt, a wonderful tool which is available free of cost to the community and is well maintained. It is also modular and allows the user to add more functionality in form of C/Lua plugins. There are some good dissectors and plugins available for Wireshark which make user's life easy but when we talk the plugins related to attack detection or macro analysis from the security point of view, there is not much available. Our PA Toolkit is such an attempt to extend the functionality of Wireshark from a micro-analysis tool and protocol dissector to the macro analyzer and threat hunter.

PA toolkit is a collection of Wireshark plugins which enables a pentester to get insights for multiple network protocols like WiFi, VoIP, ARP, DNS, DHCP, SSL etc. This eliminates the need for a separate software/framework to detect basic attacks. The plugins are easy to add and are platform independent.

Cryptocurrencies and NFT are taking over with predictions of 90% of the population holding at least one of them by the end of the decade. Users that want to facilitate these new assets, trade them and sell them typically do that using wallets, and in particular hot wallets that are easy-to-use. The most popular hot wallets today (e.g., MetaMask) are browser based and are thus vulnerable to phishing and scams made possible through malicious JavaScript, such as a recent campaign carried out by the Lazarus group which resulted in more than 400M$ worth of stolen cryptocurrencies.

We release our internal tool used by the Security Operation and the research at Akamai to scan the JS from any website.
It includes a Python recursive crawler that extracts every JS from any domain (written within the HTML or imported), analyzes it with a model and heuristics - that we provide -, and brings metadata ( from VT, publicwww…) It finally gives a score to every piece of code running on any URL of a specified domain.
The code works also as a Web App and exposes a REST API as well.

We will finish by presenting some real detection we caught with this tool and explaining them.

![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection-gray)  
Defending enterprise networks against attackers continues to present a difficult challenge for blue teams. Prevention has fallen short; improving detection & response capabilities has proven to be a step in the right direction. However, without the telemetry produced by adversary behavior, building and testing detection capabilities will be a challenging task. Executing adversary simulations in monitored environments produces the telemetry that allows security teams to identify gaps in visibility as well as build, test and enhance detection analytics

PurpleSharp is an open source adversary simulation tool written in C# that executes adversary techniques against Windows Active Directory environments. The resulting telemetry can be leveraged to measure and improve the efficacy of a detection engineering program. PurpleSharp executes different behavior across the attack lifecycle following the MITRE ATT&CK Framework's tactics: execution, persistence, privilege escalation, credential access, lateral movement, etc.

PurpleSharp executes simulations on remote hosts by leveraging administrative credentials and native Windows services/features such as Server Message Block (SMB), Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI), Remote Procedure Call (RPC) and Named Pipes.

PurpleSharp can assist blue teams in the following use cases:

- Verify prevention controls ( are Lsass dumps being blocked ? )
- Build new detection controls ( build a detection rule for T1117)
- Test/verify existing detection controls (are we really detecting process injection ?)
- dentify gaps with existing detection analytics ( broken logic, lack of coverage, etc. )
- Identify gaps in visibility ( broken agents, broken event pipelines, etc. )
- Train the SOC with credible simulations

ROADtools is a framework to interact with Azure AD. It currently consists of a library (roadlib) and the ROADrecon Azure AD exploration tool.

ROADlib is a library that can be used to authenticate with Azure AD or to build tools that integrate with a database containing ROADrecon data. The database model in ROADlib is automatically generated based on the metadata definition of the Azure AD internal API.

ROADrecon is a tool for exploring information in Azure AD from both a Red Team and Blue Team perspective. In short, this is what it does:

- Uses an automatically generated metadata model to create an SQLAlchemy backed database on disk.
- Use asynchronous HTTP calls in Python to dump all available information in the Azure AD graph to this database.
- Provide plugins to query this database and output it to a useful format.
- Provide an extensive interface built in Angular that queries the offline database directly for its analysis.

ROADrecon also provides a built-in plugin to export it's data to a custom version of BloodHound with Azure AD capabilities.

Both ROADtools and ROADrecon are completely free and open source software.


### [Real-Time AD Attack Detection: Detect Attacks Leveraging Domain Administrator Privilege](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection-gray)  
In Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) attacks, attackers tend to attack the Active Directory to expand infections. Attackers try to take over Domain Administrator privileges and create a backdoor called the "Golden Ticket". Attackers leverage this Golden Ticket to disguise themselves as legitimate accounts and obtain long-term administrator privilege. However, detecting attacks that use this method is quite difficult because the attackers' use of legitimate accounts and commands are not identified as anomalies.

We introduce a real-time detection tool that uses Domain Controller Event logs for detecting attack activities leveraging Domain Administrator privileges. Our tool can minimize the damages these types of attacks can cause even if the attackers maliciously take advantage of the Golden Ticket.

Our tool consists of the following steps to reduce false detection rate and support immediate incident response.

Step1 (Signature based detection): Analyze Event logs focusing on the characteristics of the attack activities.
Step2 (Machine Learning): Use unsupervised machine learning and anomaly detection in order to detect suspicious commands that attackers tend to use as outliers.
Step3 (Real-time alert): Raise real-time alerts using Elastic Stack if attack activities are detected.

We will publish our tool on GitHub and show specific algorithms that we have implemented so that visitors can customize or develop their own system. Our tool is all open sourced, enabling immediate and efficient incident responses against attacks at a reasonable cost.

### [Real-Time Detection Tool of High-Risk Attacks Leveraging Kerberos and SMB](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection-gray)  
In Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) attacks, attackers tend to attack against the Active Directory. Especially vulnerabilities fixed in MS14-068 and MS17-010 have been leveraged to get administrator privileges. Attackers who can get administrator privileges likely create "Golden Ticket" and "Silver Ticket" to disguise themselves as arbitrary administrative accounts for a long period. However, detecting these attacks is quite difficult since legitimate accounts and processes are leveraged. Since sometimes attackers successfully accomplish lateral movement in a short period, immediate detection is needed.

We will introduce a real-time detection tool for the following attack activities against Active Directory using Event logs and Kerberos packets.
-Attacks leveraging the vulnerability fixed in MS14-068 and MS17-010
-Attacks using Golden Ticket
-Attacks using Silver Ticket

We introduced the detection tool for Golden Ticket from Event Logs in Black Hat Europe 2018, but sometimes false positive occurs because of the Kerberos specification. In this time, we introduce the improved tool. The detection rate is improved, and introduce a new feature to detect Silver Ticket attacks.

Our tool can detect attacks against Windows 2008 R2, 2012, 2016. Additionally, our tool utilizes only Domain Controller's built-in Event Logs and minimum Kerberos packets. Thus, it can be implemented in easy way and helps immediate incident response.

Finally, ATT&CK, a knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques, is becoming common recently. The tool can identify the possible tactics for each detected attack activity automatically.

The ultimate aim of any security exercise (offensive or defensive) is to make the organization more resilient and adaptive towards modern adversaries. RedHunt OS (Virtual Machine) from RedHunt Labs aims to provide defenders a platform containing the toolset to emulate adversaries as well as advanced logging and monitoring setup to actively hunt such adversaries.

The project aims to provide a one-stop shop which defenders can quickly spin up and practice blue team exercises in the presence as well as the absence of an active attacker. On the other hand, the red team can utilize the platform to identify and understand the footprints they leave behind during a red team exercise. Apart from Adversary Emulation and Threat Hunting tools, the OS also provides Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) and Threat Intelligence tools. Both red and blue teams can utilize the setup to become better at what they do, ultimately leading to better security.

SSH to Any Device with No Ports Open
Make your devices reachable while eliminating network attack surfaces & reducing administrative overhead.

Atsign's patent pending core technology is engineered to deliver the following benefits:
Addressability
Atsign's core technology uses identifiers which replace the need to manage IP addresses. If you remember the atSign (Atsign's version of an address), you can look up the IP address and port in the atDirectory which manages this information for you.
Reachability
‍Atsign's core technology provides each device with its own microserver which makes it reachable from anywhere on the internet.
No open ports (no network attack surface) on the device
Connections are always made from the device to the microserver, meaning that no ports ever need to be opened on devices using this technology.
End-to-end encrypted
Information is automatically encrypted on the edge devices before it is sent over Atsign's control plane.
Zero Trust
Atsign's technology is designed such that cryptographic keys are only stored at the edge device. No third party or intermediary ever possesses the decryption keys which are required to access the information. You don't need to trust any of the microservers, because they never see information in the clear.
In other words, sending information using Atsign's control plane requires no open ports and is fully edge-to-edge encrypted, all without needing to know the IP address of the device!


### [SSHook: A Lightweight Syscall Hooking Tool for Uncovering Hidden Malicious Instructions](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection-gray)  
Most Android hook ways aim at watching APIs for Java or Native code. However, some malicious apps try to escape hooking and access sensitive data using syscall directly, so it is crucial in order to uncover hidden code that some malicious apps use to bypass standard hooking techniques and access sensitive data directly through system calls. We have implemented a syscall hooking tool based on Seccomp-BPF named SSHook, which gives better balance between performance and compatibility.

Seccomp-BPF was introduced into Linux kenel to filter syscalls and their arguments, we transform this security feature into a syscall hook framework which support devices range from Android 8.1 to Android 13. Our tool SSHook combined Seccomp-BPF with throwing an exception to catch syscall, and resuming instructions for normal execution by preparing additional threads earlier, which avoids frequent interruptions and possible risks like deadlocks, suspensions, or crashes. For performance improvement, we have implemented a flag that determines whether to resume execution using either the inactive parameter or the higher 4 bytes of an integer type, but the program can still run normally without any impact. Besides, SSHook is a lightweight framework but performs efficiently and robustly compared with other invasive or complicated solutions, which keep stable and reliable by standing on the shoulders of kernel features.

SSHook can help to identify suspicious behavior in malicious Apps which abuse syscall to steal privacy files or collect sensitive data like MAC, applist, which can be integrated into sandbox environment to conduct more complete dynamic analysis. Furthermore, SSHook allows us to replace syscall arguments and bypass hooking tools to evade detection, which is particularly useful in preventing the collection of device fingerprints and protecting user privacy against tracking.


### [SWEET SECURITY](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection-gray)  
Sweet Security is a network security monitoring and defensive tool which can be deployed on hardware as small as a Raspberry Pi. Using the power of Bro IDS and threat intelligence feeds, malicious network traffic can be exposed. This data is gathered and visualized with the ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kiban). Going beyond detection, the device can implement blocking for specific devices on a granular level. Sweet Security can monitor all network traffic with no infrastructure change and block unwanted traffic. It ships with Kibana dashboards, as well as a new web administration UI. Even better, the installation can be separated between web administration and sensor. Want to deploy the web administration to AWS and install a dozen sensors? No problem!

All of these tools and methodologies run on inexpensive hardware, such as the Raspberry Pi. If you're looking for a more scalable solution, these tactics and tools can be adapted to enterprise scale deployments, as well. Attendees can expect to take away methodologies they can put to use right away, from dorm-room to datacenter.


### [SYNwall: A Zero-Configuration (IoT) Firewall](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection-gray)  
A lots of words has been spent in the last years about IoT security: but instead of thinking to deploy a new device, let's try to stay on what we already have: we have a TCP/IP stack. And what we don't want to have? Complicated and cumbersome security configurations.

The aim of SYNwall is to build an easy to configure, no new hardware, low footprint, lightweight and multi-platform security layer on TCP/IP: with a one way OTP authentication, SYNwall can make every device more secure and resilient to the real world networking reconnaissance and attacks.

If we think at some of the IoT installations (may be directly internet exposed, in difficult environments, with no support infrastructure available), the possibility to have an on-board and integrated way to control access, can make a huge difference in terms of security.

The device will became virtually unaccessible to anyone who don't have the proper OTP key, blocking all the communications at the very first level of it: the SYN packet. No prior knowledge of who need to access is required at this point, making configuration and deploy a lot easier.


### [Sandbox Scryer](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection-gray)  
"Sandbox Scryer: An open source tool leveraging free sandbox technologies to enable threat hunting and intelligence"

When defending against APTs or Advanced Persistent Threats, persistent is the most important aspect of that definition. Often a security solution will stop a threat actor on initial access, when they inject command and control beacons into processes, or when they move laterally. Which leads to important questions. What's next? Will the actor try again? What are they after? How do I improve my defenses when the threat actor inevitably tries again?

A defender must be able to answer these questions. SoC analyst time is among the most valuable in any organization, and automated research tools such as sandboxes can be a valuable solution to accelerate this process. Unfortunately, making sense of all the data takes time. Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) are invaluable for communicating actionable intelligence about attacks, as is identifying relevant secondary payloads and top ATT&CK tactics and techniques among all the data a sandbox can generate. This critical information can be used to drive threat hunting, assessment of attack success and penetration, and pre-emptive identification of risk of future attack.

In this demonstration, we will showcase an open source tool, the Sandbox Scryer, which performs sample submission to the free Hybrid Analysis Sandbox, retrieval of results of the Sandbox's automated analysis, and extraction from these sets of important IOCs and techniques matched against MITRE Att&ck. This open source tool will be made available, which enables an organization to adapt it to their favorite free or paid sandbox (of which there are many), along with expanding it to produce of types of IOCs.


### [Sandboxing in Linux with zero lines of code](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection-gray)  
Linux seccomp is a simple, yet powerful tool to sandbox running processes and significantly decrease potential damage in case the application code gets exploited. It provides fine-grained controls for the process to declare what it can and can't do in advance and in most cases has zero performance overhead.

The only disadvantage: to utilize this framework, application developers have to explicitly add sandboxing code to their projects and developers usually either delay this or omit completely as their main focus is mostly on the functionality of the code rather than security. Moreover, the seccomp security model is based around system calls, but many developers, writing their code in high-level programming languages and frameworks, either have little knowledge to no experience with syscalls or just don't have easy-to-use seccomp abstractions or libraries for their frameworks.

All this makes seccomp not widely adopted—but what if there was a way to easily sandbox any application in any programming language without writing a single line of code? This presentation discusses potential approaches with their pros and cons.


### [Sigma Hunting App for Splunk](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection-gray)  
The Sigma Hunting App for Splunk addresses two main challenges: missing collaboration in detection rule development and automated deployment of detection rules. By using Sigma as an generic signature description language, security analysts and security researcher from all over the world can work together independent from their SIEM tool. The joint detection rule development improves the general detection capabilities of the Security Operations Centers. The manual deployment of a detection rule in Splunk was a time-consuming task in order to complete all the needed fields for a scheduled search. The Sigma Hunting App solves that problem by providing a dedicated Splunk App, which can be used to dynamically update Sigma detection rules from a Git repository.

Furthermore, the Sigma Hunting App supports the analyst in their investigations of triggered detection rules. The triggered detection rules are stored as events in a separate threat-hunting index enriched with data of the Mitre ATT&CK Matrix.

The audience should learn the following aspects:

A modern approach of detection rule development
Continuous Delivery in detection rule development through the Sigma Hunting App
Installing and configuring the Sigma Hunting App
Automated deployment of detection rules into Splunk
Features of the Sigma Hunting App
Using Sigma Hunting App to find suspicious behavior


### [SimpleRisk: Governance, Risk Management & Compliance](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection-gray)  
As security professionals, almost every action we take comes down to making a risk-based decision. Web application vulnerabilities, malware infections, physical vulnerabilities, and much more all boils down to some combination of the likelihood of an event happening and the impact it will have. Risk management is a relatively simple concept to grasp, but the place where many practitioners fall down is in the tool set. The lucky security professionals work for companies who can afford expensive GRC tools to aide in managing risk. The unlucky majority out there usually end up spending countless hours managing risk via spreadsheets. It's cumbersome, time consuming, and just plain sucks. After starting a Risk Management program from scratch at a $1B/year company, Josh Sokol ran into these same barriers and where budget wouldn't let him go down the GRC route, he finally decided to do something about it. SimpleRisk is a simple and free tool to perform organizational Governance, Risk Management, and Compliance activities. Based entirely on open source technologies and sporting a Mozilla Public License 2.0, a SimpleRisk instance can be stood up in minutes and instantly provides the security professional with the ability to manage control frameworks, policies, and exceptions, facilitate audits, and perform risk prioritization and mitigation activities. It is highly configurable and includes dynamic reporting and the ability to tweak risk formulas on the fly. It is under active development with new features being added all the time. SimpleRisk is Enterprise Risk Management simplified.

### [Slips: A machine-learning based, free-software, P2P Network Intrusion Prevention System](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection-gray)  
For the last 7 years we developed Slips, a behavioral-based intrusion prevention system, and the first free-software network IDS using machine learning. Slips profiles the behavior of IP addresses and performs detections inside each time window in order to also *unblock* IPs. Slips has more than 20 modules that detect a range of attacks both to and from the protected device. It is an network EDR with the capability to also protect small networks.

Slips consumes multiple packets and flows, exporting data to SIEMs. More importantly, Slips is the first IDS to automatically create a local P2P network of sensors, where instances share detections following a trust model resilient to adversaries..

Slips works in several directionality modes. The user can choose to detect attacks coming *to* or going *from* these profiles, or both. This makes it easy to protect your network but also to focus on infected computers inside your network, which is a novel technique.

Among its modules, Slips includes the download/manage of external Threat Intelligence feed (including our laboratory's own TI feed), whois/asn/geocountry enrichment, a LSTM neural net for malicious behavior detection, port scanning detection (vertical and horizontal) on flows, long connection detection, etc. The decisions to block profiles or not are based on ensembling
algorithms. The P2P module connects to other Slips to share detection alerts.

Slips can read packets from the network, pcap, Suricata, Zeek, Argus and Nfdump, and can output alerts files and summaries. Having Zeek as a base tool, Slips can correctly build a sorted timeline of flows combining all Zeek logs. Slips can send alerts using the STIX/TAXII protocol.

Slips web interface allows to clearly see the detections and behaviors, including threat inteligence enhancements. The interface can show multiple Slips runs, summarize whois/asn/geocountry information and much more.


### [Slips: Free software machine learning tool for Network Intrusion Prevention System](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection-gray)  
Slips is the first free software, behavioral-based, intrusion prevention system to use machine learning to detect attacks in the network. It is a modular system that profiles the behavior of devices and performs detections in time windows. Slips' modules detect a range of attacks both to and from the protected devices.

Slips detect attacks to and from devices protecting your network but also focusing on infected computers. All the analyses are reevaluated in time windows so computers can be unblocked if they are cleaned. Avoiding permanent detections when the risk is gone.

Slips manages Threat Intelligence feeds (44 external feeds, including our own), the enrichment with WHOIS/ASN/geo location/mac vendors. Allowing it to detect MITM attacks, scans, exfiltration, port scans, long connections, data uploads, unknown ports, connections without DNS, malicious JA3/JA3S, TLS certificates, etc.

An LSTM neural network detects C&C channels, a Random Forest is used to detect attacks on flows, and anomaly detection methods are used on the traffic. A final ML ensembling algorithm is used for blocking decisions and alert generation.

Slips reads packets from an interface, PCAPs, Suricata, Zeek, Argus and Nfdump. It generates alerts in text, json, and using the STIX/TAXII protocol, sending to CESNET servers using IDEA0 format, or to Slack.

Slips is the first IDS to use its own local P2P network to find other Slips peers and exchange data about detection using trust models that are resilient to adversarial peers.

The Kalipso Node.js and a Web interface allows the analysts to see the profiles' behaviors and detections performed by Slips modules directly in the console. Kalipso displays the flows of each profile and time window and compares those connections in charts/bars. It also summarizes the whois/asn/geocountry information for each IP in your traffic.

Do you know what is internet accessible in your AWS environments? The answer and methodology of how you arrive at the answer may be the difference between missing critical exposures and complete situational awareness. Dynamic and ephemeral exposures are being created on an unprecedented level and your old generation of tools, techniques, and internet scanners can't find them. Let us show you how to find them and what it means for the future of unwanted exposures. A comprehensive asset inventory is step one to any capable security program. What does having an accurate inventory mean to an AWS administrator and ongoing security engineering effort?

Our approach involves leveraging AWS security services and metadata to translate the raw configuration into patterns of targetable services that a security team can utilize for further analysis.

In this presentation we will look at the most pragmatic ways to continuously analyze your AWS environments and operationalize that information to answer vital security questions. Demonstrations include integration between IAM Access Analyzer, Tiros Reachability API, and Bishop Fox CAST Cloud Connectors, along with a new open source tool SmogCloud to find continuously changing AWS internet-facing services.

Key Takeaways:
+ Learn how to continuously maintain an inventory of AWS services and understand their internet-exposures
+ Discover how to leverage automation from AWS Access Analyzer and a freely available open source tool from Bishop Fox to operationalize exposure testing
+ See practical demonstrations of how engineering and security teams can determine impact of their security group configurations


### [Splunk Threat Hunting Application](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection-gray)  
This is a Splunk application containing several dashboards and over 120 reports that will facilitate initial hunting indicators to investigate. One of the reasons this app was created is because the endpoint is an often used entry way into a network. There are quite some Endpoint Detection & Remediation (EDR) solutions out there and most of them are quite good; however, they can be costly and not everyone is able to afford that (yet).

The goal was to create an alternative approach to the detection aspect, using the MITRE ATT&CK framework and work with the existing environment. It allows you to leverage your existing data platform, in this case Splunk.


### [StegoWiper+: A Powerful and Flexible Active Attack for Disrupting Stegomalware and Advanced Stegography](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection-gray)  
Over the last 10 years, many threat groups have employed stegomalware or other steganography-based techniques to attack organizations from all sectors and in all regions of the world. Some examples are: APT15/Vixen Panda, APT23/Tropic Trooper, APT29/Cozy Bear, APT32/OceanLotus, APT34/OilRig, APT37/ScarCruft, APT38/Lazarus Group, Duqu Group, Turla, Vawtrack, Powload, Lokibot, Ursnif, IceID, etc.Our research shows that most groups are employing very simple techniques (at least from an academic perspective) and known tools to circumvent perimeter defenses, although more advanced groups are also using steganography to hide C&C communication and data exfiltration. We argue that this lack of sophistication is not due to the lack of knowledge in steganography (some APTs have already experimented with advanced algorithms) but simply because organizations are not able to defend themselves, even against the simplest steganography techniques.

During the demonstration we will show the practical limitations of applying existing automated steganalysis techniques for companies that want to prevent infections or information theft by these threat actors. For this reason, we have created stegoWiper, a tool to blindly disrupt any image-based stegomalware, attacking the weakest point of all steganography algorithms: their robustness. We'll show that it is capable of disrupting all steganography techniques and tools (Invoke-PSImage, F5, Steghide, openstego, ...) employed nowadays. In fact, the more sophisticated a steganography technique is, the more disruption stegoWiper produces. Moreover, our active attack allows us to disrupt any steganography payload from all the images exchanged by an organization by means of a web proxy ICAP (Internet Content Adaptation Protocol) service, in real time and without having to identify which images contain hidden data first.

After our presentation at BlackHat USA 2022 Arsenal we have been working on supporting, disrupting, state-of-the-art advanced algorithms available in the academic literature, based on matrix encryption, wet-papers, etc. (e.g. Hill, J-Uniward, Hugo). Especially we have paid attention to the YASS algorithm (https://pboueke.github.io/CryptoStego/) resistant to numerous active attacks and commercial CDR-type software. Finally our tool is able to defeat them.


### [Stop Wasting Time: Use Falco Plugins to Extend Detection with any Event Stream](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection-gray)  
Data leaks can cost companies a fortune, storing millions of logs which "might" come in handy in the future. The majority of the time, only a small portion of those logs are actually useful in the event of a security investigation. Using newly developed Falco plugins, you can generate live events for the point in time you are interested in and forward those for further analysis, speeding and simplifying incident response.

Falco is a CNCF open source container security tool designed to detect anomalous activity in your local machine, containers, and Kubernetes clusters. It taps into Linux kernel system calls and Kubernetes Audit logs to generate an event stream of all system activity. Thanks to its powerful and flexible rules language, Falco will generate security events when it finds malicious behaviors as defined by a customizable set of Falco rules.

The recent major Falco update introduced support of Falco Plugins, opening Falco to a new world of data that Falco can handle and process. This new approach allows users to create and integrate different types of Falco plugins and extend the Falco detection engine with new event sources and generate security events using Falco rules. The event sources that can be integrated in Falco are infinited. AWS CloudTrail, Docker, and Video Stream are already available, and the Falco community is already working on new plugins to integrate new event sources.

During this talk, we show the new Falco plugins approach and how you can use it in real breaches. The recent OKTA breach is a perfect example. By developing the related plugin and Falco rules for OKTA events, it was possible to detect and get an immediate alert if something anomalous happened in your environment.


### [Strafer: A Tool to Detect Infections in Elasticsearch Instances](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection-gray)  
Elasticsearch infections are rising exponentially. The adversaries are exploiting open and exposed Elasticsearch interfaces to trigger infections in the cloud and non-cloud deployments. During this talk, we will release a tool named "STRAFER" to detect potential infections in the Elasticsearch instances. The tool allows security researchers, penetration testers, and threat intelligence experts to detect compromised and infected Elasticsearch instances running malicious code. The tool also enables you to conduct efficient research in the field of malware targeting cloud databases.




In this version of the tool, the following modules are supported:

Elasticsearch instance information gathering and reconnaissance
Elasticsearch instance exposure on the Internet
Detecting potential ransomware infections in the Elasticsearch instances
Detecting potential botnet infections such as meow botnet.
Detecting infected indices in the Elasticsearch instances

Note: This is the first release of the tool and we expect to add more modules in the nearby future.


### [Streamlining and Automating Threat Hunting With Kestrel](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection-gray)  
Kestrel is a rapidly evolving threat hunting language designed to accelerate cyber threat hunting by providing a layer of abstraction to build reusable, composable, and shareable hunt-flow. It brings two key innovations to the security community: (i) a composable way expressing threat hypothesis development over entity-relational data abstractions, and (ii) an open-source language runtime generating and executing repetitive hunt instructions on local hunting sites, remote data sources, and in the cloud. Kestrel significantly simplifies hunting and sharing by creating a standard way to encode a single hunt step, chain multiple hunt steps, and fork/merge hunt-flows to develop threat hypothesis. It focuses threat hunters on the reusable business logic of hunt, other than writing multiple endpoint query languages, understanding incompatible query results, and converting analytics and visualization for each specific hunt.

This arsenal session will showcase the latest language development and community opportunities for Kestrel. We will start with powerful federated data retrieval using the Structured Threat Information eXpression (STIX) standard and STIX-shifter and lift the results into an entity-relational data model. Then we will showcase analytic hunt steps besides data retrieval steps, compare the new Python analytics interface with the container-based interface, and execute analytics for context enrichment, de-obfuscation, and visualization. After creating, executing, saving, and re-executing huntbooks, we will connect Kestrel with the Open Command and Control (OpenC2) standard to respond to "investigate" commands and automate huntbook execution, data gathering, false positive elimination, and comprehensive analysis.

Making it ready to try by the audience, we will demonstrate live hunts in Jupyter Notebooks launched and executed in a Binder cloud sandbox as part of a purple team exercise. At the end of the session, we will introduce the kestrel-huntbook repo for people to reuse existing huntbooks and share their hunting knowledge with their colleagues and other hunters in the community.


### [SubParse - Malware Artifact and Correlation Framework](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection-gray)  
SubParse is a modular framework designed for the automation of malware analysis using static and dynamic analysis, external threat intelligence sources and historical data/event correlation. The novelty of this approach comes in the correlation of extracted data to not only assist in identification of current samples, but also in correlating any facet of information with other samples stored within the framework. Data will be accessible through an intuitive web-based user interface which offers a comprehensive filter syntax sub-system.

Static file identification and parsing is the entry point into the framework. Currently, the scope of the framework is to support Windows-based portable executable (PE) files and Linux executables (ELF). However, the modularity of the framework allows for the easy integration of additional file parsers through plugins. Static file characteristics can be extracted using file format parsing, such as: file hashes, compile time, version information, code entry address, and section information. Across a larger sample set these attributes can offer unique views into threat actor operations and allow for the correlation of previously uncorrelated samples.

Analysis can be further enriched using enricher plugins. After completion of the static file parsing, the framework looks for any enabled enrichers. Enrichers provide an open-ended opportunity to gather additional data about the sample and add it to the framework. For example, an enricher that utilizes services provided by Abuse.ch can provide additional insight into malware behavior.

Another key enricher provides dynamic analysis. The framework will orchestrate dynamic analysis using a CAPEv2 sandbox. Dynamic analysis will provide behavioral insights into the malware, such as process activity, memory allocations and network activity. These results will be exported from CAPE and correlated with the sample within SubParse. For these artifacts, they will be submitted to the framework for full analysis and correlated to the original sample.

![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection-gray)  
Telfhash is an architecture-agnostic hash based on symbols of ELF files. It can also cluster ELF files with no symbols based on a creative algorithm to cluster them. Designed as a Python library, Telfhash is also shipped with a command-line tool that allows malware researchers to correctly group similar ELF files together. In this demo I'll show you how Telfhash works and how to extract the most of it while conducting malware investigations that involves ELF files, which is a common situation in this IoT/non-PC malware era.


### [The Big zBang Theory: Active Directory Risk Assessment](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection-gray)  
zBang is an Active Directory Risk Assessment tool that alerts against five different Active Directory attack vectors: ACLight, Skeleton Key, SID History, Risky SPN, and Mystique.

Organizations and red-teamers should utilize zBang to identify potential attack vectors and improve the security posture of the network. The results can be analyzed with a graphic interface specifically designed for the tool.

The new zBang tool discovers critical findings like:

The most privileged accounts that must be protected, including suspicious Shadow Admins.
Possible infected DCs with the "Skeleton Key" malware.
Suspicious SID history with hidden privileges.
Risky configurations of SPNs that might lead to credential theft of domain admins.
Risky Kerberos delegation configurations in the network.

The scans do not require any extra privileges; the tool performs read-only LDAP queries to the DC and can be run using any domain user.


### [The Eye of Falco: You can escape but not hide](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection-gray)  
Container technologies rely on features like namespaces, cgroups, SecComp filters, and capabilities to isolate different services running on the same host. However, SPOILER ALERT: container isolation isn't bulletproof. Similar to other security environments, isolation is followed by red-teamer questions such as, "How can I de-isolate from this?"

Capabilities provide a way to isolate containers, splitting the power of the root user into multiple units. However, having lots of capabilities introduces complexity and a consequent increase of excessively misconfigured permissions and container escape exploits, as we have seen in recently discovered CVEs.

Falco is a CNCF open source container security tool designed to detect anomalous activity in your local machine, containers, and Kubernetes clusters. It taps into Linux kernel system calls and Kubernetes Audit logs to generate an event stream of all system activity. Thanks to its powerful and flexible rules language, Falco will generate security events when it finds malicious behaviors as defined by a customizable set of Falco rules.

The recent Falco update introduced the feature to keep track of all the syscalls that may modify a thread's capabilities, modifying its state accordingly, allowing Falco to monitor capabilities assigned to processes and threads. This new feature allows users to create detection over those malicious misconfigurations and automatically respond by implementing actions to address the issue

In this talk, we explain how you can use Falco to detect and monitor container escaping techniques based on capabilities. We walk through show real-world scenarios based on recent CVEs to show where Falco can help in detection and automatically respond to those behaviors


### [ThreatPatrol](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection-gray)  
ThreatPatrol is a powerful open-source SaaS tool that offers Blue Teams a wealth of information on potential threats, allowing them to gain situational awareness and perform threat hunting. The tool's flexibility is a significant advantage, as it can be hosted on the cloud or on an internal standalone machine, providing users with the convenience and customisation options they need.

ThreatPatrol offers a comprehensive database of over 160 threat actor groups, indicators of compromise (IOCs), tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), and their modus operandi out of the box. This information is regularly updated to ensure that users have access to the latest information on potential threats, providing insights into emerging threats and enabling proactive measures to prevent cyber-attacks.

Cyber Defenders can add, update, or degrade TTPs and IOCs for their network and map them to the MITRE Framework, which can be visualised on the dashboard in graph form, and generate reports for sharing with executive members. By proactively collecting and analysing data on potential threats, cyber teams can improve their situational awareness, enabling them to take appropriate action to prevent or mitigate attacks.

ThreatPatrol also provides feeds from over 100+ different sources, allowing organisations to stay up-to-date with the latest attack methods and trends, adjust their security posture, and protect themselves better against cyber threats. With improved situational awareness, organisations can respond more quickly and effectively when incidents occur, making ThreatPatrol an essential tool for protecting valuable data and avoiding the devastating consequences of a cyber-attack.


### [ThreatScraper: Automated Threat Intelligence Gathering and Analysis from VirusTotal](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection-gray)  
The continuous growth of malware threats necessitates efficient and comprehensive tools for tracking malware detection and propagation. VirusTotal serves as a popular platform for aggregating malware information submitted by Anti-Virus (AV) software providers, which can be searched using parameters such as hashes (SHA-1, SHA-256, MD5), file names, and malicious web links. In order to enhance and automate the process of malware intelligence gathering, we introduce ThreatScraper, a Python-based tool that automates free API queries and rescanning tasks on VirusTotal.
ThreatScraper is designed to periodically request reports on specified files and save the results in a local database. It allows users to pull and aggregate malicious file reports from multiple AV vendors over time, providing insights into the adoption of malware detection across providers. Easily implemented from any Windows command line, ThreatScraper can rescan a file, pull a report, and then sleep until the next designated time identified by the user.
By leveraging ThreatScraper, developers can efficiently identify potentially malicious files, track when an AV provider has flagged a file as malicious and monitor the categorization of the file. The tool ultimately aids in enhancing threat intelligence gathering and response capabilities for users, developers, and enterprise entities.


### [Trash Taxi: Taking Out the Garbage in Your Infrastructure](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection-gray)  
Auditors dream of a world in which they can guarantee that few possess unrestricted administrator access. Yet, developers and operations staff often need to debug complex events - that only occur with load - in production. How can we balance the need to grant occasional superuser access with the incentive to ensure changes make their way back into configuration management, while reducing the risk of configuration drift? We built Trash Taxi to help us understand why people use "sudo -i," and also clean up hosts that have had arbitrary commands run on them by "taking out the trash" as in: terminating them.


### [Unprotect Project: Malware Evasion Techniques](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection-gray)  
Malware evasion consists of techniques used by malware to bypass security in place, circumvent automated and static analysis as well as avoiding detection and harden reverse engineering. There is a broad specter of techniques that can be used. In this talk we will review the history of malware evasion techniques, understand the latest trends currently used by threat actors and bolster your security analysis skills by getting more knowledge about evasion mechanisms.

We will present the latest major update of the Unprotect Project an open-source documentation about malware evasion techniques. The goal will be to present the project and see how we can leverage it for use cases, including threat intelligence, malware analysis, strengthen security, train people, and extend the Mitre ATT&CK matrix. Over the years it has become a well renowned place for security researchers. During this talk we will review some of the most important update.

This presentation can benefit both Blue and Red Team as it will provide knowledge and information on how malware can bypass your security in place and stay under the radar. You will learn about the intrinsic mechanisms used by attackers to compromise you without you even realizing it!

### [Wabhawk/Catch - Unsupervised Machine Learning Detection](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection-gray)  
Webhawk/Catch helps automatically finding web attack traces in HTTP logs without using any preset rules. Based on the usage of Unsupervised Machine Learning, Catch groups log lines into clusters, and detects the outliers that it considers as potentially attack traces. The tool takes as input a raw HTTP log file (Apache, Nginx..) and returns a report with a list of findings.

Catch uses PCA (Principal Component Analysis) technique to select the most relevant features (Example: user-agent, IP address, number of transmitted parameters, etc.. ). Then, it runs DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) algorithm to get all the possible log line clusters and anomalous points (potential attack traces).

Advanced users can fine tune Catch based on a set of options that help optimising the clustering algorithm (Example: minimum number of points by cluster, or the maximum distance between two points within the same cluster).

The current version of Webhawk/Catch generates an easy-to-read HTML report which includes all the findings, and the severity of each one.


### [Weapons of Office Destruction: Prevention with Machine Learning](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection-gray)  
The broad-brush popularity of Microsoft (MS) Office documents led them to become one of the main cyber-attacking vectors to spread malware via email attachments or web downloads. The first major outbreak of its kind is the notorious macro-based malware "Melissa" during the turn of last century and this century. Since 2014 we started to see rising weaponized Office documents, particularly visual basic application (VBA) macro-based attacks (banking Trojan like "Dridex" or ransomware such as "Locky"). According to a Sophos report in 2017, over 80% of document-based malware were delivered via MS Word or Excel files. Even though these attacks are not new in nature, the increasing volume and complexity of the attacks impose huge challenges to traditional signature-based anti-virus (AV) products.

As a countermeasure, AV companies have spent an enormous amount of effort creating heuristic rules over decades for signature-based detection. To better leverage the rules already used in traditional AV solutions, we propose to combine them statistically using a simple random forest-based machine learning (ML) classifier. In this demonstration, a comprehensive list of over 3000 existing heuristic rules is used to train the ML model. The training data feed comprises around 92600 real-world benign and malicious MS Office documents including Word, Excel and PowerPoint file formats. The testing datasets include 17929 malicious files and 12511 benign files collected recently. Evaluation results indicate that the proposed approach exhibits enhanced performance and significantly outperforms eleven well known commercial anti-virus scanners with a much higher true positive rate (TPR) of 98.46% achieved while maintaining a low false positive rate (FPR) of 0.33%. Of the evaluated commercial AV scanners, the best one achieves only a TPR of 87.5%, which is more than 10% lower than the proposed ML model.


### [White Phoenix - Beating Intermittent Encryption](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection-gray)  
Intermittent Encryption (aka Partial Encryption) is a new trend in the world of ransomware. It's been adopted by many notorious groups such as BlackCat Ransomware, Play Ransomware and more. Altogether, the groups using intermittent encryption have successfully targeted hundreds of organizations in 2022 alone. However, even though intermittent encryption has its advantages, it leaves much of the content of targeted files unencrypted. In this talk, we will demonstrate a tool that uses this limitation to recover valuable data, such as text and images from documents encrypted by these groups, allowing the victims to recover some of their lost data.


### [YAMA: Yet Another Memory Analyzer for Malware Detection](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection-gray)  
YAMA is a system for generating tools that can inspect whether specific malware is present in memory during incident response. While numerous security countermeasure products exist for malware detection, targeted attacks utilizing malware that operates only in memory remain challenging to detect using existing products and continue to pose a threat.
Looking at existing open-source software (OSS) projects, some, such as PeSieve and Moneta, perform memory scans on live memory. However, few offer detection methods specifically tailored to particular malware for live systems. As file-less malware threats increase, having the means to verify the presence of malware in memory across multiple endpoints becomes crucial in incident response.
Using our proposed YAMA system, the scanner generated can create memory scanners tailored explicitly to any malware. The scanner generated by YAMA is a standalone executable capable of running on most 64-bit Windows OS. When infection investigation of malware present only in memory is required during incident response, executing the scanner created by YAMA on the suspected device will easily detect whether it is infected. Furthermore, in cases where a large-scale infection is suspected, the scanner can be distributed via Active Directory (AD) to clarify the infection status within the network.
YAMA is expected to be a powerful support tool for enhancing the investigative capabilities of Blue Teams, who conduct incident response daily.


### [YAWNING-TITAN](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection-gray)  
YAWNING-TITAN is an abstract, graph based cyber-security simulation environment that supports the training of intelligent agents for autonomous cyber operations. YAWNING-TITAN focuses on providing a fast simulation to support the development of defensive autonomous agents who face off against probabilistic red agents. YAWNING-TITAN has been designed with the following things in mind:

• Simplicity over complexity;
• Minimal Hardware Requirements;
• Operating System agnostic;
• Support for a wide range of algorithms;
• Enhanced agent / policy evaluation support;
• Flexible environment and game rule configuration;
• Generation of evaluation episode visualisations (gifs).

YAWNING-TITAN contains a small number of specific, self-contained OpenAI Gym environments for autonomous cyber defence research, which are great for learning and debugging; it also provides a flexible, highly configurable generic environment which can be used to represent a range of scenarios of increasing complexity and scale. The generic environment only needs a network topology and a settings file to create an OpenAI Gym compliant environment which enables open research and enhanced reproducibility.

When training and evaluating an agent, YAWNING-TITAN can be run from either a command-line interface, or a graphical user interface (GUI). The GUI allows the underlying Python to be executed without need for a command line interface or knowledge of the python language. The GUI also integrates with a customised version Cytoscape JS which has been extended to work directly with YAWNING-TITAN, and allows users to directly interface with network topologies that subsequently updates a database of stored networks. Both the command-line interface and the GUI provide read-outs throughout agent training and evaluation, as well as generation of a final summary.

Today, the malicious behavior of hackers is aimed at all kinds of terminals, servers, and websites. Sadly, when the hacker came, did something, and took away what we didn't know, in many cases. However, no matter what the hacker did, his behavior in the network could not be erased. Zhouhe is a free tool/platform, it has detection rules and machine learning algorithms maintained by a team of experts to detect threats, it provides network threat analysis and detection capabilities. You only need to upload traffic files to let you quickly understand the threats and malicious behaviors in the network.


### [capa: Automatically Identify Malware Capabilities](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection-gray)  
capa is an open-source tool that detects capabilities in programs to reduce the time-to-triage and make malware analysis more accessible. Anyone dealing with potentially malicious programs and especially forensic, intelligence, and malware analysts can use capa to understand a sample's capabilities, role (downloader, backdoor, etc.), and any suspicious or unique functionality.
capa takes automated malware triage to the next level going from simply saying "this is probably bad" to providing a concise description of what a program actually does. This report provides critical, decision-making information to anyone dealing with malware.

capa uses a new algorithm that reasons over the features found in a file to identify its capabilities. The lowest level features range from disassembly tricks to coding constructs, while intermediate features include references to recognized strings or API calls. Users compose rules that train capa how to reason about features – and even the significance of other rules. This makes it easy for the community to extend the tool's abilities.

We will describe how and why our tool works. We will also show to use it to enhance every malware analysis workflow. Furthermore, you will learn how to develop capability detections that extend capa.


### [eBPFShield: Advanced IP-Intelligence & DNS Monitoring using eBPF](#)

### [eBPFShield: Unleashing the Power of eBPF for OS Kernel Exploitation and Security.](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection-gray)  
Are you looking for an advanced tool that can help you detect and prevent sophisticated exploits on your systems? Look no further than eBPFShield. Let's take a technical look at some of the capabilities of this powerful technology:

DNS monitoring feature is particularly useful for detecting DNS tunneling, a technique used by attackers to bypass network security measures. By monitoring DNS queries, eBPFShield can help detect and block these attempts before any damage is done.

IP-Intelligence feature allows you to monitor outbound connections and check them against threat intelligence lists. This helps prevent command-and-control (C2) communications, a common tactic used by attackers to control compromised systems. By blocking outbound connections to known C2 destinations, eBPFShield can prevent attackers from exfiltrating sensitive data or delivering additional payloads to your system.

eBPFShield Machine Learning feature, you can develop and run advanced machine learning algorithms entirely in eBPF. We demonstrate a flow-based network intrusion detection system(IDS) based on machine learning entirely in eBPF. Our solution uses a decision tree and decides for each packet whether it is malicious or not, considering the entire previous context of the network flow.

eBPFShield Forensics helps address Linux security issues by analyzing system calls and kernel events to detect possible code injection into another process. It can also help identify malicious files and processes that may have been introduced to your system, allowing you to remediate any security issues quickly and effectively.

During the workshop, we'll delve deeper into these features and demonstrate how eBPFShield can help you protect your systems against even the most advanced threats.


### [h0neytr4p - How to catch the external threat actors with an easy to configure Honeypot.](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection-gray)  
Working for large clients, we realised that large enterprises don't have any mechanism to trap external threat actors primarily exploiting web vulnerabilities. They are still reliant on threat intel firms to block potential attacker IPs. Sure, there are honeypots but it's really hard and time taking to configure. The turnaround time for SOC teams to configure a honeypot for a recently disclosed vulnerability is very high, discouraging the use of the same. We aim to fix this by introducing a template based honeypot. Honeytrap is stateless, it understands patterns and it can be configured to catch complicated 0day or 1day vulnerability exploitation attempts within minutes. It empowers and encourages blue teams to put an active honeytrap network around the network which can be used to capture Indicators of compromise that can be used to block at the perimeter firewall. h0neytr4p comes in a light weight single binary deployment mode, takes either one or multiple templates as input and has csv output mode which can be easily piped onto custom tools. Currently, it supports HTTP and HTTPS only but the plan is to make it a unified platform that supports SSH, RDP or any other protocols spanning multiple scenarios.


### [ioc2rpz: Where Threat Intelligence Meets DNS](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection-gray)  
DNS is the control plane of the Internet with unprecedented detailed views on applications, devices and even transferred data going in and out of a network. 80% of malware uses DNS to communicate with Command & Control for DNS data exfiltration/infiltration and phishing attacks using lookalike domains. Response Policy Zones or DNS Firewall is a feature which allows us to apply security policies on DNS. Commercial DNS Firewall feeds providers usually do not allow users to generate their own feeds. Cloud only DNS service providers do not provide feeds for on-prem DNS.

ioc2rpz is a DNS server which automatically creates, maintains and distributes DNS Firewall feeds from various local (files, DB) and remote (http, ftp, rpz) sources. This enables easy integrations with Threat Intel providers and Threat Intelligence Platforms. The feeds can be distributed to any open source and commercial DNS servers which support RPZ, e.g. ISC BIND, PowerDNS, Infoblox, BlueCat, Efficient IP etc. With ioc2rpz you can create your own feeds, actions and prevent undesired communications before they happen.

https://ioc2rpz.net is a community portal which is powered by ioc2rpz where you can try several free DNS Firewall feeds.

RpiDNS is a new feature integrated into ioc2rpz.gui which includes an installation script and a web interface to monitor and manage local secure DNS services.

### [stegoWiper: A powerful and flexible active attack for disrupting stegomalware](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection-gray)  
Over the last 10 years, many threat groups have employed stegomalware or other steganography-based techniques to attack organizations from all sectors and in all regions of the world. Some examples are: APT15/Vixen Panda, APT23/Tropic Trooper, APT29/Cozy Bear, APT32/OceanLotus, APT34/OilRig, APT37/ScarCruft, APT38/Lazarus Group, Duqu Group, Turla, Vawtrack, Powload, Lokibot, Ursnif, IceID, etc.
Our research shows that most groups are employing very simple techniques (at least from an academic perspective) and known tools to circumvent perimeter defenses, although more advanced groups are also using steganography to hide C&C communication and data exfiltration. We argue that this lack of sophistication is not due to the lack of knowledge in steganography (some APTs have already experimented with advanced algorithms) but simply because organizations are not able to defend themselves, even against the simplest steganography techniques.
During the demonstration we will show the practical limitations of applying existing automated steganalysis techniques for companies that want to prevent infections or information theft by these threat actors.
For this reason, we have created stegoWiper, a tool to blindly disrupt any image-based stegomalware, attacking the weakest point of all steganography algorithms: their robustness. We'll show that it is capable of disrupting all steganography techniques and tools (Invoke-PSImage, F5, Steghide, openstego, ...) employed nowadays, as well as the most advanced algorithms available in the academic literature, based on matrix encryption, wet-papers, etc. (e.g. Hill, J-Uniward, Hugo). In fact, the more sophisticated a steganography technique is, the more disruption stegoWiper produces.
Moreover, our active attack allows us to disrupt any steganography payload from all the images exchanged by an organization by means of a web proxy ICAP (Internet Content Adaptation Protocol) service, in real time and without having to identify which images contain hidden data first.

The original code of a malware must be scanned using YARA rules after processing with a debugger (or other means) to account for obfuscated malware binaries. This is a complicated process and requires an extensive malware analysis environment. The tknk_scanner is a community-based integrated malware identification system, which aims to easily identify malware families by automating this process using an integration of open source community-based tools and freeware. The original malware code can be scanned with with your own YARA rules by submitting the malware in PE format to the scanner. tknk_scanner can thus support surface analysis performed by SOC operators, CSIRT members, and malware analysts.

### [vPrioritizer: Learn to say NO to almost every vulnerability (art of risk prioritisation…)](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Blue--Team--&--Detection-gray)  
As suggested by vulndb and cve, on a daily basis, approximately 50 new vulnerabilities become known to industry and even if an organization considers the impact rate of 10%, it’s still very challenging to manage it effectively and it’s safe to assume that count is going to increase furthermore. So with this amount organization is focusing (or should focus) on reducing the risk rather than eliminating it.

In current era, vulnerability management is (almost) equal to risk prioritisation because

- Resources (skillset and time) is limited in every organisation
- Environment is changing too fast and too frequently (ROI is less in analysis and remediation of a vulnerability if affected asset is not going to be live for a longer time - small attack surface)
- Attack surface is increasing exponentially in diversity (which again comes down to prioritisation)
- Remember the 80/20 rule - 20% of vulnerabilities bring 80% of risk

So what is risk? How do we calculate it? What are the factors contributing to risk?

1. CVSS (historically used) - No
2. Asset Criticality - No
3. Asset Accessibility - No
4. Exploit Applicability - No
5. Exploit Availability - No
6. Ease of Exploitation - No
7. Attack Surface - No
8. All of the Above - Yes

Theoretically, the above approach looks appropriate to adopt but practically it’s not possible to do it manually for every vulnerability affecting every asset by every organisation.

To overcome the above challenges I have prepared an open-source framework, vPrioritizer, which gives us ability to assess the risk on different layers such as (and hence comprehensive control on granularity of each component of risk):

- We can assign significance on per asset basis
- We can assess severity on per vulnerability basis
- At the same time, we can adjust both factors at asset & vulnerability relationship level
- On top of that, community analytics provides insights as suggested risk

This framework enables us to understand the contextualized risk pertaining to each asset by each vulnerability across the organization. It’s community based analytics provides a suggested risk for each vulnerability identified by vulnerability scanners and further strengthens risk prioritization process. So at any point of time teams can make an effective and more informed decision, based on unified and standardized data, about what (vulnerability/ties) they should remediate (or can afford not to) on which (asset/s).

- Blue teamers/infra security - Getting an automated API inventory and getting alerts for any new sensitive APIs. They can also get a view of all sensitive PII data being shared across all their services and across all their APIs. They can check unauthenticated APIs, download the swagger file and use it in other security apps too.


### [Analyzing SAP Communication Security: Introducing sncscan](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Web/AppSec](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Web/AppSec-gray)  
SAP systems are used around the world to handle crucial business processes and highly confidential data such as financial details or information regarding a company's staff. To ensure confidentiality and integrity, sensitive data, and especially access credentials, must only be transmitted over encrypted communication channels. Transport layer encryption for SAP systems is provided by the Secure Network Communications (SNC) protocol. Currently, the configuration of the SAP SNC protocol (such as the Quality of Protection parameter or the installed CryptoLib) can only be audited with authenticated access to the SAP system or by manually connecting to the system through the SAP GUI. These approaches have additional requirements and are impractical for assessing the security of a larger number of systems.

To address the beforementioned issues, we developed 'sncscan', an SNC scanner, that works without authentication and similar to the various tools that are available to analyze the security of services that use SSL/TLS. To achieve this, 'sncscan' starts SNC handshakes with varying encryption parameters to the tested service and analyzes the returned error messages and responses. This is especially useful in context of professional penetration tests and enables us to identify configuration weaknesses and provide actionable recommendations on improving the transport security in SAP environments.

'sncscan' benefits from the tools and research of the `pysap` project and will be released as Open-Source tool in the OWASP CBAS-SAP project. It aims to enable security researchers, professional penetration testers and SAP basis administrators to verify the correct use of the SNC protocol.

Currently 'sncscan' can analyze the SNC configuration of the SAP Router protocol. The next steps are to implement similar functionality for the protocols DIAG and RFC to increase the coverage of SAP services.

![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Web/AppSec](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Web/AppSec-gray)  
REST API penetration testing is complex due to continuous changes in existing APIs and the addition of new APIs. Astra (Sanskrit: अस्त्र) can be used by security engineers or developers as an integral part of their process, so they can detect and patch vulnerabilities in the initial phase of the development cycle. Astra can automatically detect and test login & logout (Authentication API), which makes it easy for anyone to integrate this into CICD pipeline. Astra can take API collection as an input so this can also be used for testing APIs in stand-alone mode.


### [BURPSMARTBUSTER: A SMART WAY TO FIND HIDDEN TREASURES](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Web/AppSec](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Web/AppSec-gray)  
This tool is the anticipated replacement of a better dirb/gobuster/DirBuster. Bruteforcing non-indexed data is often used to discover hidden files and directories which can lead to information disclosures, or even to system compromise when a backup file is found. This bruteforcing technique is still useful today, but the tools are lacking the application context and do not use any smart behaviour to reduce the bruteforce scanning time. BurpSmartBuster, a Burp Suite Plugin, offers to use the application context and add the smart into the Buster!

This demo will reveal this open-source plugin with its new features and show a practical case of how you can use this new tool to accelerate your Web pentesting to find hidden treasures! The following will be covered:

How to add context to a web bruteforce tool
How we can be stealthier
How smart context-based data can be used to find hidden files and directories
How simple the code is and how you can help to make it even better!

Introducing these new features:

Scan items based on the technologies of the webapp and web server (Basic ex: PHP files should not be scan on an ASPX application OR if SharePoint is in use scans its webservices).
This includes the new technology scanner class and results which are scanned
If time permits, Community data: Each time an items is find, the data is sent anonymously to a server compiling trend of hidden items found in the wild and will share the information to all

### [Burp Replicator: Automate Reproduction of Complex Vulnerabilities](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Web/AppSec](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Web/AppSec-gray)  
Developers often struggle to reproduce vulnerabilities discovered during pen tests. This is especially true for complex issues that need to bypass JavaScript validation, work with multi-step forms, handle dynamic CSRF tokens and more. This does not fit well with agile development where the ability to quickly reproduce problems enables efficient test driven development. Replicator solves this issue by allowing a pen tester to create a reproduction script that a developer can use on their system. Complex vulnerabilities can be confirmed with a single click, allowing the developer to stay in their productive coding flow. The tool is fully integrated with Burp Suite, making the script greatly easier to produce than a shell script, and keeping the tester in productive flow.

### [Daksh SCRA (Source Code Review Assist Tool)](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Web/AppSec](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Web/AppSec-gray)  
Daksh SCRA is an open source tool that assists with manual source code review by providing helpful information to the code reviewer. This tool differs from traditional code review tools because it aims to help reviewers collect various details about the code base and identify areas of interest to review and confirm potential vulnerabilities. Even if code reviewers use automated code review tools, there are still many manual tasks they must perform to confirm findings and ensure precision in the code review process.

Although there are numerous automated code review tools available, none of them can perform a reconnaissance of the code base and provide code reviewers with useful insights. Typically, code reviewers must search for relevant information to confirm findings or ensure precision. Daksh SCRA offers valuable information such as technology and platform usage, functionalities, use cases, vulnerable patterns, and libraries used, among other data.

While most code review tools search for vulnerable patterns, they often report a high percentage of false positives. Daksh SCRA, on the other hand, is designed to be a reconnaissance tool that provides code reviewers with maximum insights about the target code base to assist with precise code review. Although Daksh SCRA is in its infancy stage, it is still a usable tool that supports a wide range of languages and platforms, and new features will be added in future releases.

In the modern digital realm, internet browsers, particularly Chrome, have transcended traditional boundaries, becoming hubs of multifunctional extensions that offer everything from AI-integrated chatbots to sophisticated digital wallets. This surge, however, comes with an underbelly of cyber vulnerabilities. Hidden behind the guise of innovation, malicious extensions lurk, often camouflaged as benign utilities. These deceptive extensions not only infringe upon user privacy and security but also exploit users with unasked-for ads, skewed search results, and misleading links. Such underhanded strategies, targeting the unsuspecting user, have alarmingly proliferated.

Addressing this conundrum, we present DetectiveSQ - an advanced command-line interface designed to rigorously audit Chrome extensions. At its core, DetectiveSQ is engineered to be compatible with both Manifest V2 (MV2) and Manifest V3 (MV3) architecture, ensuring a wide-ranging applicability across extensions of different generations. Through an intricate examination of permissions - delving deep into how they're invoked and utilized within the extension's codebase - DetectiveSQ brings forth potential security and privacy breaches. The tool not only assesses permissions but also correlates them with actual behaviors, scripts, and external calls, offering a holistic evaluation. DetectiveSQ will be open source and made available after the talk.

![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Web/AppSec](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Web/AppSec-gray)  
AI-based hacking tools are here and taking aim at your network perimeter. With recent advances in machine learning, hackers can now solve tasks that previously required human experience and decision making. Our open source tool Eyeballer uses a convolutional neural network to sift through mountains of screenshots and tells the hacker what is likely to have vulnerabilities and what isn't, just by looking at it.

You know a busted website when you see one: broken HTML, blocky frames—something obviously written in raw PHP before MVC frameworks even existed, made custom by your target over a decade ago. Signature-based scanners won't help you find this diamond-in-the-rough vulnerability. And who has time to look through 100,000 EyeWitness screenshots to find your most likely entry point? This is where AI comes in to give those websites a quick eyeballing so you don't have to.

The future of hacking will augment human expertise with AI analysis. To help spur this on, we'll be releasing both the source code behind Eyeballer and our training dataset of tens of thousands of carefully curated website screenshots. We'll also be showing off live demos of the whole thing so you can witness for yourself the results of melding machine and man.


### [FTW: FRAMEWORK FOR TESTING WAFS](#)

### [FUZZAPI - FUZZING YOUR RESTAPIS SINCE YESTERDAY](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Web/AppSec](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Web/AppSec-gray)  
After seeing the benefits of Automating REST API pen testing using a basic Fuzzapi tool, the authors have decided to come up with a better version which can automatically look into vulnerabilities in APIs from the time they are written. REST APIs are often one of the main sources of vulnerabilities in most web/mobile applications. Developers quite commonly make mistakes in defining permissions on various cross-platform APIs. This gives a chance for the attackers to abuse these APIs for vulnerabilities. Fuzzapi is a tool written in Ruby on Rails which helps to quickly identify such commonly found vulnerabilities in APIs which helps developers to fix them earlier in SDLC life cycle. The first released version of the tool only has limited functionalities however, the authors are currently working on releasing the next version which will completely automate the process which saves a lot of time and resources.

### [Introducing RAVEN: Discovering and Analyzing CI/CD Vulnerabilities in Scale](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Web/AppSec](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Web/AppSec-gray)  
As the adoption of CI/CD practices continues to grow, securing these pipelines has become increasingly important. However, identifying vulnerabilities in CI/CD pipelines can be daunting, especially at scale. In this talk, we present our tooling, which we intend to release as open-source software to the public that helped us uncover hundreds of vulnerabilities in popular open-source projects' CI/CD pipelines.

RAVEN (Risk Analysis and Vulnerability Enumeration for CI/CD) is a powerful security tool designed to perform massive scans for GitHub Actions CI workflows and digest the discovered data into a Neo4j database. With RAVEN, we were able to identify and address potential security vulnerabilities in some of the most popular repositories hosted on GitHub, including FreeCodeCamp (the most popular project on GitHub), Storybook (One of the most popular frontend frameworks), Fluent UI by Microsoft, and much more.
This tool provides a reliable and scalable solution for security analysis, enabling users to query the database and gain valuable insights into their codebase's security posture.

### [KICS](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Web/AppSec](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Web/AppSec-gray)  
KICS is an open-source solution for static code analysis of Infrastructure as Code. It finds security vulnerabilities, compliance issues, and infrastructure misconfigurations in the following Infrastructure as Code solutions: Terraform, Kubernetes, Docker, AWS CloudFormation, Ansible. And more to come. Over 1000 rules are already available.


### [KICS: Keeping Infrastructure-as-Code Secure](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Web/AppSec](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Web/AppSec-gray)  
Infrastructure as Code (IaC) makes deploying cloud or container configurations scalable and faster. If you are launching a microservice into a Kubernetes cluster, or even building an entire AWS virtual infrastructure, IaC can automate the deployment. By building repeatable templates you can also ensure that deployments happen exactly as you design, every time.

However, errors in infrastructure configuration are now regarded as the second biggest cause of data breaches. There are many ways to give adversaries an advantage through security misconfigurations. Overly permissive storage volumes, unauthenticated database access, or ports left open to the internet have all been a cause of compromise. The solution? Treat your infrastructure code the same as your application code. During your build process, use tools to scan for infrastructure misconfigurations. When you find them raise alerts or even break the build. 

In this session, we will discuss common types of IaC misconfigurations, and demonstrate a free, open source security tool that developers can build into their pipelines to help protect infrastructure from compromise.

### [Kurukshetra: Playground for Interactive Security Learning](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Web/AppSec](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Web/AppSec-gray)  
Kurukshetra is a web framework that's developed with the aim of being the first open source framework which provides a solid foundation to host reasonably complex secure coding challenges where developers can learn secure coding practices in a hands-on manner. It is composed of two components, the backend framework written in PHP, which manages and leverages the underlying docker system to provide the secure sandbox for the challenge execution, and the frontend, which is a user facing web app providing all the necessary controls, for the admin to host and modify the challenges, and the user to execute and view the result of each of his input.

The Framework currently supports challenges written in 4 major languages including PHP, Python, NodeJS and Ruby.


### [LazyCSRF: A More Useful CSRF PoC Generator on BurpSuite](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Web/AppSec](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Web/AppSec-gray)  
Burp Suite is an intercepting HTTP Proxy, and it is the defacto tool for performing web application security testing. The feature of Burp Suite that I like the most is `Generate CSRF PoC`. However, the function to automatically determine the content of the request is broken, and it tries to generate PoCs using `form` even for PoCs that cannot be represented by `form`, such as JSON parameters and PUT requests. In addition, multibyte characters that can be displayed in Burp Suite itself are often garbled in the generated CSRF PoC. These were the motivations for creating LazyCSRF.


I have implemented a feature to solve them. It has the following features:
- Automatically switch to PoC using XMLHttpRequest
- In case the parameter is JSON
- In case the request is a PUT/PATCH/DELETE
- Support displaying multibyte characters (like Japanese)
- Generating CSRF PoC with Burp Suite Community Edition (of course, it also works in Professional Edition)

### [Makes: A tool for avoiding supply chain attacks](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Web/AppSec](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Web/AppSec-gray)  
As the open-source ecosystem keeps growing, and applications increase their reliance on public libraries, we also see a spike in supply chain attacks. Recent scandals like SolarWinds or Log4j remind us how exposed software is when it comes to malicious, vulnerable or broken packages. Modern applications have thousands of dependencies, which means that managing dependency trees only becomes harder over time, while exposure keeps rising.

Think about how often you need things like

- keeping execution environments frozen for a strict dependency control (I'm looking at you, supply chain attacks);
- running applications locally so you can try whatever you are coding;
- executing CI/CD pipelines locally so you can make sure jobs (Linters, tests, deployments, etc.) are passing;
- running applications anywhere, no matter what OS you are using;
- knowing the exact dependency tree your application has for properly managing risk (Software Bill of Materials);
- making sure applications will work as expected in production environments.

At Fluid Attacks, we have experienced such concerns firsthand. That is why we created Makes, an open-source framework for building CI/CD pipelines and application environments in a way that is

- secure: Direct and indirect dependencies for both applications and CI/CD pipelines are cryptographically signed, granting an immutable software supply chain;
- easy: Can be installed with just one command and has dozens of generic CI/CD builtins;
- fast: Supports a distributed and completely granular cache;
- portable: Runs on Docker, VM's, and any Linux-based OS;
- extensible: Can be extended to work with any technology.

Makes is production ready and used currently in 11 different products that range from static and dynamic websites to vulnerability scanners. It was released on GitHub in July 2021 and has already been starred 170 times. It currently has 9 contributors from the community and gets a minor update each month.


### [Mal2Vec: Word2Vec Variant for Analytics of Web Attacks](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Web/AppSec](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Web/AppSec-gray)  
Word2Vec is one of the most successful and popular technologies for Natural Language Processing. It facilitates the understanding of the semantics of words using their context. Many other domains adopted the Word2Vec approach and used embedding of domain objects in Euclidean spaces for distance calculation, clustering, visualization and more.

Mal2Vec is a Word2Vec-based framework for analytics of security incidents that helps the analyst understand the contextual relations between attack vectors, and thus to understand better attack flows. The tool looks at malicious web request as words and at sequences of malicious web requests as sentences, and applies a variant of Word2Vec to embed the attack vectors in Euclidean space and to analyze their contextual relations. Using this approach, the analyst can get better understanding of the attack flows, e.g., he can see which attack vectors tend to come together.

While we developed Mal2Vec to improve our understanding of web attack based on analysis of security events of Web Application Firewall (WAF), we also provide an easy customization flow that will make it useful for analytics of other cyber-attack data.


### [ModSecurity 3.0](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Web/AppSec](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Web/AppSec-gray)  
ModSecurity is a toolkit for real-time web application monitoring, logging, and access control. I like to think about it as an enabler: there are no hard rules telling you what to do; instead, it is up to you to choose your own path through the available features.


### [ModSecurity 3.1: Stepping up the Game for Web Attacks](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Web/AppSec](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Web/AppSec-gray)  
With this upcoming release of ModSecurity we are delivering improved performance, stability and new exciting features!

We are bringing the possibility of virtual patch on demand through the ability of reloading the rules without restart among other improvements in that area. Additionally, we will be showing a testing feature that is exclusive to ModSecurity that allows rules writers and WAF administrators to effortlessly search and match for known malware payloads and signatures. This intends to step-up the game on the detection and blocking of countless types of malware and exploits.

In this presentation we will also be demonstrating the flexibility of ModSecurity by showing the feasibility of running a WAF inside an IoT device.

This release includes around 300 commits since the first 3.0 release with fixes, improvements and features added to the bleeding edge version of the open source libModSecurity. It contains a number of improvements in different areas: These include, clean ups, better practices for improved code readability, resilience, overall performance, support to a few missing features, LuaJIT and a number of fixes to actions and transformations.

Last but not least, there's an improved user experience while reading the logs with a new API component that allows the unique id informed on transactions, making possible to match an id that it is already in use by the consuming application (the connector).


### [N3XT G3N WAF 2.0](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Web/AppSec](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Web/AppSec-gray)  
Previously, we introduced N3XT G3N WAF (NGWAF) 1.0 at BHUSA 2022. The novel WAF 3.0 tool that seeks to relieve complex and difficult WAF detection mechanism with detection utilising a Sequential Neural Network (SNN) and traps attackers through a custom honeypotted environment. These assets are all dockerised for scalability.

However, further experiments have proven that a SNN may not be the most optimal when it comes down to contextualised defence as it processes information in a step by step and sequential manner. It gets relatively cumbersome and ineffective detecting chained or contexualised attacks. Both of which are extremely common in today's attacks.

Thus, we took another approach by swapping out our "brains". We revamped the SNN and went with a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). The RNN is a much better choice for contextualised defense as the output of each layer is fed back as the input of the same layer. Thus, this allows the network to maintain a "memory" of the data it has processed. Our latest model is a RNN with a bi-directional LSTM module, it has an accuracy of 0.995 and a f1 score of 0.993.

We have also upgraded NGWAF's scalability in model deployment, model maintenance and the overall detection pipeline. This is all done with cloudifying the operations of the entire Machine Learning detection module. As compared to version 1.0 where users have to install and run the entire framework on their local system, NGWAF 2.0 has employed Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) scripts, which auto-deploys the machine learning model's training & maintenance pipeline onto AWS resources (Sagemaker). The detection module has also been shifted from local deployment to AWS Sagemaker where we are able to standardise the hardware utilised for the ML model. This also allows further decoupling of the detection module from the rest of the system and allow for greater customisability.

### [Nekuda: IDN-Squatting Detector](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Web/AppSec](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Web/AppSec-gray)  
Put yourself in the shoes of a fraudster, you are trying to create a phishing website. Why inserting detectable unicode characters into a mostly-ASCII domain when you can register an entire domain in unicode? This is available when one uses a lesser-known feature called Internationalized Domain Name Top Level Domains (IDN TLD). Consider registering domains like google.com's lookalike in Hebrew - גוגל.קום, アマゾン.コム in Japanese instead of amazon.com or 微软.公司 which is the Chinese equivalent of microsoft.com.

Nekuda (dot in Hebrew) assists blue teamers to detect such domains. Its input is a string (e.g. the blue teamer's employer Brand name) and it emits over 150 potential IDN TLD domains and its registration status. It covers a potential gap in proactive phishing detection and prevention strategies and can be easily integrated into existing open-source tools like dnstwist.


### [Node Security Shield - A Lightweight RASP for NodeJS Applications](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Web/AppSec](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Web/AppSec-gray)  
Node Security Shield (NSS) is an Open source Runtime Application Self-Protection (RASP) tool which aims at bridging the gap for comprehensive NodeJS security.

NSS is designed to be Developer and Security Engineer friendly and enables them to declare what resources an application can access.

Inspired by the Log4Shell vulnerability which can be exploited because an application can make arbitrary network calls, we felt there is a need for an application to have a mechanism so that it can declare what privileges it allows in order to make the exploitation of such vulnerabilities harder by implementing additional controls.

In order to achieve this, NSS (Node Security Shield) has a Resource Access Policy and the concept is similar to CSP (Content Security Policy). Resource Access Policy lets developer/security engineers declare what resources an application should access and Node Security Shield will enforce it.

If the Application is compromised and requests 'attacker.com' or executes a malicious command. Node Security Shield will block it automatically and thus protect the application from malicious attacks.

Node Security Shield was first announced in Black Hat Asia 2022 Arsenal.

Later at Black Hat USA 2022 arsenal (Virtual), the first major update was released which adds support for the 'module-level' Resource Access Policy. Allowing Developers or Security Engineers to declare what resources a module can access.

This release is a major update and adds support for Command Execution. Allowing Developers or Security Engineers to declare if the application can execute system commands. If allowed, what type of system commands are allowed.

### [Patronus: Swiss Army Knife SAST Toolkit](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Web/AppSec](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Web/AppSec-gray)  
Patronus is a fully dockerised and comprehensive config driven Security Framework which helps to detect security vulnerabilities in the Software Development Life Cycle of any application. The framework inculcates a highly automated approach for vulnerability identification and management. With Patronus's fully whitebox approach, the framework currently covers four major verticals; Secrets Scanning, Software Composition Analysis, Static Application Security Testing and Asset Inventory. Finding all these four verticals together is a very strenuous task in the industry as no other framework currently solves this like Patronus which provides a fully comprehensive dashboard containing all the four verticals in a single central platform, and this is something very unique to Patronus. Patronus automatically identifies the latest code commits and focuses on the major aspects of the application source code to identify and detect key and high severity vulnerabilities within the application and aims for minimal false positives in the reports.

The framework focuses on the needs of the security engineers and the developers alike with a dedicated web dashboard to abstract all the nitty gritty technicalities of the security vulnerabilities detected and also empowers the user with higher level of vulnerability tracking for better patch management. The dashboard is built completely with analytics, functionality and maintaining ease in mind to demonstrate and display various metrics for the scans and vulnerabilities. It also helps to search, analyse and resolve vulnerabilities on-the-go and provides a completely consolidated vulnerability report.

Patronus is very powerful and hugely reduces the time and efforts of the security team in thoroughly reviewing any application from a security lens. The framework comes with an on-demand scanning feature apart from the scheduled daily automated scans, using which developers and security engineers can scan particular branches and repositories at any point of time in the SDLC, directly from the dashboard or integrations like Slack. The framework is completely adaptable and various softwares like Slack and Jira can be easily integrated directly with Patronus for better accessibility and tracking since most organisations today use these extensively.

### [RIDE: Efficient Highly-Precise Systematic Automatic Bug Hunting in Android Systems](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Web/AppSec](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Web/AppSec-gray)  
Vulnerabilities in various android systems such as the AOSP and vendor-specific components directly impact user security & privacy and should be eliminated. Do we have a way to efficiently identify bugs in ready-to-ship phones conveniently and precisely? From a researcher perspective, vendor codes are mainly closed-source which means they cannot use open-source auditing tools and usually the only obtainable resource is phone firmware. From vendor QA and security team's perspective, the ability to perform a systematic vulnerability assessment directly on ready-to-ship phone images would also be much more useful and easier than maintaining complex dependency and version information on each model.

We come up with a framework named RIDE (Rom Intelligent Defect assEsment) that directly operates on factory images of major android systems such as AOSP, Samsung, Huawei, Xiaomi, Oppo etc, which discovered 40+ CVEs including critical and high severity level bugs in the vendors in less than one year. RIDE combines highly precise whole-program static taint analysis and dynamic blackbox binary fuzzing to pinpoint vulnerabilities in user-space code such as system apps, system services and bundled closed-source libraries. In this talk, we will share in detail about the system's design and architecture, including the whole-program static analysis algorithm and implementation with high precision and acceptable performance, and the blackbox fuzzing component which is fed by the information collected from previous static analysis. Also, we will share the detail and exploitation of several bugs found, which range from system-level arbitrary file read/write/code execution to RCE ones in AOSP and other major vendors etc.

### [ReDTunnel: Explore Internal Networks via DNS Rebinding Tunnel](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Web/AppSec](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Web/AppSec-gray)  
Did you wonder how you could browse target's internal network without deploying anything on the victim machine? Sounds like magic, right? Imagine that you could have a one-click setup that will provide you a magic tunnel from the outside world. That's when we came up with the "ReD Tunnel" idea. The design goal was to use tools that exist on the victim's device, like the browser, rather than rely on 0days to stay below the radar of the most advanced AV. To create this new capability, we decided to combine two concepts: JavaScript reconnaissance techniques and the DNS rebinding attack. Open your browser, wait until the victim visits your website and start browsing the internal websites in their network. Now, when red-teaming you could really "be a guest, but feel at home".

### [Route Sixty-Sink: Connecting Application Inputs to Sinks Using Static Analysis](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Web/AppSec](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Web/AppSec-gray)  
Route Sixty-Sink is an open source static analysis tool that traces the flow of user input through any .NET binary and determines whether it is passed as an argument to a dangerous function call (a "sink"). Route Sixty-Sink does this using two main modules:

1. RouteFinder, which enumerates API routes in MVC-based and classic ASP page web applications.
2. SinkFinder, which takes an entry point and creates a call graph of all classes and method calls. Then, it queries strings, method calls, and class names for "sinks".

By tying these two pieces of functionality together, Route Sixty-Sink is able to quickly identify high fidelity vulnerabilities that would be difficult to discover using black box or manual static analysis approaches.

We have used Route Sixty-Sink to reveal and successfully exploit vulnerabilities including unsafe object deserialization, SQL injection, command injection, arbitrary file uploads and access, authorization bypasses, and more in both open-source and proprietary .NET applications.


### [SASTRI: Plug and Play VM for SAST/*Static Application Security Testing Realtime Integration*/](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Web/AppSec](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Web/AppSec-gray)  
Abiding by the new hot concept of "Secure By Design," SASTRI is project carved out of the experiences/struggles/conflicts of product security engineers. It is an in-house SAST capability (plug and play VM) we are proposing, to make security engineers' inputs more receivable and reachable to the product developers and the decision-makers - while making our products more and more secure. This will save a lot of security engineers' and DevOps experts' time when it coms to setting up and fine tuning the SAST tools.

Highlights of SASTRI are:

Open source (hence free to edit and reconfigure)
Presently capable of scanning Python, C, C++ programs
Almost zero understanding of security principles is required to "run" SASTRI. (For bug resolution, yes definitely a deep understanding is required)
Automated bug reporting
Email alert for the issues reported
Same email contains attachment of report where buggy code snippet is mentioned along with the exact position of bug
Easy to integrate approach

SASTRI is an effort towards making SAST tools available right at the time of unit testing of code, in an automated way. The reason being, in most of Agile flavors of development, security testing is done in the end of the sprint, leaving very little to no time for bug fixes. Also, the smaller time window for security testing results in "not so in depth security testing" and "superficial fixes."
However, on the other hand, introducing security testing right at the programming phase in SDLC, can help in:

Finding vulnerabilities which are easy to exploit but difficult to mitigate
Finding vulnerabilities which are present due to complicated execution paths
Finding vulnerabilities specific to insecure configuration
Setting up basic secure code development principles amongst developers (Trust me this is the trickiest task, as most of the Devs are super possessive about their code and coding styles.

Also, this effort can help reduce apprehensions of security engineers when uploading source code on some vendors server which they do not trust. The list of advantages is huge; we have tried generalize them to the least count possible.

### [Semgrep: a code-aware grep for finding vulnerabilities and enforcing secure defaults](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Web/AppSec](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Web/AppSec-gray)  
Semgrep is a tool for easily detecting and preventing bugs and anti-patterns in your codebase. It combines the convenience of grep with the correctness of syntactical and semantic search.

Semgrep is fast (scans 100Ks LOC in seconds), supports multiple languages (JavaScript, Python, Golang, Java, C), and is easy to customize, so that users can create high value org-specific or project-specific checks without spending weeks learning a complicated DSL.

Semgrep works by parsing source code into an abstract syntax tree (AST), then allows users to supply patterns that fuzzily match the interesting code patterns. Because it's source code aware, its checks are higher signal than regexes (i.e., it's easy to match function calls, and not match text in comments, multi-line calls, or strings), but because it isn't doing interprocedural dataflow analysis, it doesn't take hours to run and won't make assumptions that result in hundreds of false positives requiring triage.

### [SupplyShield: Protecting your software supply chain](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Web/AppSec](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Web/AppSec-gray)  
SupplyShield is a comprehensive supply chain security framework aimed at defending against the increasingly sophisticated attacks posed by software supply chain vulnerabilities. With numerous organizations hosting hundreds of micro-services and thousands of builds occurring daily, effectively monitoring the software supply chain to construct the final application becomes a complex challenge. This is where SupplyShield can assist any organization in seamlessly integrating this framework into their Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) to ensure software supply chain security.

The current framework version is predominantly designed for the AWS environment. Any organization utilizing AWS infrastructure can seamlessly implement this framework with minimal effort via AWS CloudFormation templates to enhance the security of their supply chain. The framework mainly focuses on generating and maintaining a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) and performing Software Composition Analysis (SCA) for all the micro-services within an organization. The scans are event-driven, targeting the final micro-service image pushed into AWS ECR. As a result, it generates an SBOM of base image binaries and 3rd-party packages introduced by developers, and performs SCA on top of that. This approach provides a comprehensive view of the software components involved in the overall development of a micro service.

Built with scalability in mind, SupplyShield is capable of generating an SBOM and performing SCA in a CI/CD environment where thousands of builds take place daily. SupplyShield enables the rapid detection of zero-day vulnerabilities, such as the log4j exploit, even for organizations with over 100 micro-services, significantly reducing the Mean Time To Detect (MTTD) to mere minutes. This significantly simplifies the tasks of both security engineers and developers in identifying and managing patches for events like the log4j vulnerability. The framework also offers a dashboard for developers and security engineers, presenting relevant metrics and actionable insights.

Imagine pentesting a large web application with hundreds of pages and forms, as well as user roles and tenants. You discover that your chosen username is reflected in many locations inside the application, but you don't have a detailed overview. You want to test whether the chosen username is handled properly or allows for injection attacks, such as Cross-Site Scripting or Server-Site Template Injection. Now you face the challenge of finding all locations where your payloads appear when injecting into the username. In large applications, you'll likely miss some, potentially leaving vulnerabilities undetected.

This is where FlowMate comes into play, our novel tool to detect data flows in applications for enhanced vulnerability assessments. FlowMate consists of two components: A BurpSuite plugin and a data flow graph based on Neo4j. It records inputs to the application as you go through the pages. In contrast to existing tools that require server-side access, FlowMate works from a black-box perspective by observing HTTP request and response pairs. Thereby FlowMate records all input parameters and locations as well as user-supplied values. In parallel, all HTTP responses from the server are matched against the central store of already identified parameter values to find occurrences of known input parameters. This results in a data graph, mapping inputs to outputs simply while using the application.

Understanding the data flow results in a significant improvement of test coverage in web app pentests, as all input and output occurrences of parameters can be systematically tested for vulnerabilities. More precisely, analysts can use FlowMate in the following ways: First, for a given input parameter, FlowMate shows all output locations, thus enabling verification of output filtering and encoding, even across role, tenant, and session boundaries. Second, for a given form, FlowMate visualizes all parameters and their respective output locations across the application.

### [Threagile: Agile Threat Modeling Toolkit](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Web/AppSec](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Web/AppSec-gray)  
If we can build software in a reliable, reproducible and quick way at any time using Pipeline-as-Code and have also automated security scans as part of it, how can we quickly capture the risk landscape of agile projects to ensure we didn't miss an important thing? Traditionally, this happens in workshops with lots of discussion and model work on the whiteboard. It's just a pity that it often stops then: Instead of a living model, a slowly but surely eroding artifact is created, while the agile project evolves at a faster pace.

In order to counteract this process of decay, something has to be done continuously, something like "Threat-Model-as-Code" in the DevSecOps sense. The open-source tool Threagile implements the ideas behind this approach: Agile developer-friendly threat modeling right from within the IDE. Models editable in developer IDEs and diffable in Git, which automatically derive risks including graphical diagram and report generation with recommended mitigation actions.

The open-source Threagile toolkit runs either as a command line tool or a full-fledged server with a REST-API: Given information about your data assets, technical assets, communication links, and trust boundaries as input in a simple to maintain YAML file, it executes a set of over 40 built-in risk rules (and optionally your custom risk rules) against the processed model. The resulting artifacts are diagrams, JSON, Excel, and PDF reports about the identified risks, their rating, and the mitigation steps as well as risk tracking state.

Agile development teams can easily integrate threat modeling into their process by maintaining a simple YAML input file about their architecture and the open-source Threagile toolkits handles the risk evaluation.

The open-source tool Threagile enables agile teams to create a threat model directly from within the IDE using a declarative approach: Given information about the data assets, technical assets, communication links, and trust boundaries as input in a simple to maintain YAML file, it executes a set of over 40 built-in risk rules, which can be extended with custom risk rules, against the processed model. The resulting artifacts are graphical diagrams, Excel, and PDF reports about the identified risks, their rating, and the mitigation steps as well as risk tracking state. DevSecOps pipelines can be enriched with Threagile as well to process the JSON output.


### [ThreatPlaybook](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Web/AppSec](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Web/AppSec-gray)  
Threat Modeling is currently performed as a 'static' exercise, where the security team creates threat models as documents. These documents tend to be largely unused by anyone after the threat model and ends up being a static document. ThreatPlaybook is a "Threat Modeling as Code" framework, where you can capture Threat Models in a "playbook style" manner. Once you do, you can automatically generate diagrams, use the Threat Models to run application security automation like Vulnerability Scanning, etc.

The key benefits of ThreatPlaybook is that you can:
* Codify Threat Models for Iterative Threat Modeling
* Use Threat Models and Security Test Cases to launch targeted application security automation that can be used in a CI/CD environment or by pen testers who want to automate several tasks in their "Pentest Pipeline"
* Auto-generate Process Flow Diagrams from Codified Threat Models
* Capture Security Test Cases linked to Threat Modeling
* Generate reports correlating Threat Models to Vulnerabilities, Security Test Cases and so on.

APIs are a critical part of modern mobile, SaaS, and web applications and can be found in customer-facing, partner-facing, and internal applications.

By nature, APIs expose application logic and sensitive data, potentially leading to data breaches, account takeovers, and much more.

Because of this, APIs have increasingly become a target for attackers. Without secure APIs, organizations would face many security risks and rapid innovation would be impossible.

It is extremely important to be aware of the OWASP API top 10 risks and enforce proper API security mitigations for your APIs. Therefore, we developed c{api}tal - an Open Source API training and learning platform by Checkmarx.

c{api}tal is a built-to-be-vulnerable API application based on the OWASP top 10 API vulnerabilities. Use c{api}tal to learn, train and exploit API Security vulnerabilities within your own API Security CTF.

In DefCon30, 2022, we first introduced c{api}tal to the world by conducting an API security CTF event to allow users to learn about the API security top 10 risks and exploit them in an isolated, vulnerable platform. Now we're open sourcing it.

In this session, you will learn about:
- The OWASP API top 10 risks
- c{api}tal overview
- Demo of exploiting one of the OWASP API top 10 risks
- How to mitigate API risks to keep your APIs safe

![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Web/AppSec](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Web/AppSec-gray)  
pytm is a Pythonic framework for threat modeling. Developers can define their system in Python code as a collection of objects and annotate them with properties. Security practitioners can add threats to the "Threats" object (see https://github.com/izar/pytm/blob/master/pytm/threats.py). The logic lives in the "condition" of the "Threats" object, where members of target can be logically evaluated. If the "condition" returns a "True", that means the rule found a potential threat. More details at https://github.com/izar/pytm

Usage:
tm.py [-h] [--debug] [--resolve] [--dfd] [--report] [--all]
[--exclude EXCLUDE] [--seq]

optional arguments:
-h, --help show this help message and exit
--debug print debug messages
--resolve identify threats
--dfd output DFD (default)
--report output report
--all output everything
--exclude EXCLUDE specify threat IDs to be ignored

reNgine is an open-source reconnaissance engine that does end to end reconnaissance with the help of highly configurable scan engines to gather more information about the target for web application penetration testing. reNgine makes use of various open-source tools and makes a configurable pipeline of reconnaissance. With the recent release, reNgine also makes it possible to periodically perform the reconnaissance, say perform reconnaissance every 24 hours or so. With the highly configurable YAML based engines, reNgine makes it possible for users to choose the tools they desire while following the same reconnaissance pipeline, example - with reNgine you aren't limited to just using sublist3r for subdomains discovery, rather reNgine allows you to combine multiple tools like sublister, subfinder, assetfinder and easily integrate them into your reconnaissance pipeline. The reconnaissance results are then displayed into a beautiful and structured UI, which is one of the most loved features of reNgine.

Some Key Features are
>Subdomain Discovery, Ports Discovery, Endpoints Discovery, Directory Bruteforce, Visual Reconnaissance (Screenshot the targets)
>IP Discovery, CNAME discovery, Subdomain Takeover Scan
>Highly configurable scan engines
>Run multiple scans in parallel
>Run Clocked Scans (Run reconnaissance exactly at X Hours and Y minutes)
>Run Periodic Scans (Runs reconnaissance every X minutes/hours/days/week)
>Vulnerability Scan (Coming soon)

![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Red--Teaming](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Red--Teaming-gray)  
As the evolution of endpoint, egress, and network security controls continues, adversaries and pentesters are finding it increasingly more difficult to execute malicious payloads within properly-hardened enterprise networks. Although tools currently exist to aid in circumventing these controls, the current state fails to properly account for some of newest techniques used by these controls. Enter Empty-Nest, a command-and-control (C2) toolset created with circumvention in mind. Empty-Nest was designed to provide a flexible payload-generation mechanism and pluggable interface to enable adversaries to easily customize payloads for targeted security control bypass. Our presentation shows the Empty-Nest toolset, demonstrating how to leverage the pluggable interface to create keyed payloads capable of bypassing new-age, cloud-based binary analysis, unloading endpoint software DLLs from running processes, customizing C2 transports, and more.

### [ACsploit: Exploiting Algorithmic Complexity Vulnerabilities](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Red--Teaming](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Red--Teaming-gray)  
Algorithmic Complexity (AC) vulnerabilities arise when a program uses an algorithm with a particularly inefficient worst-case computational complexity, and allows a user to provide input that will trigger it. Determining whether a program is vulnerable requires more than an understanding of what algorithms the program implements. It also requires understanding
how user input is filtered and formatted before it's given to the potentially exploitable algorithm. One way to do this is with time consuming manual analysis, such as reverse engineering, static code review, or debugging. Alternatively, feeding the algorithm input formatted to trigger its worst case, and then measuring the effects in time (i.e. CPU utilization) and space (e.g. RAM or disk usage) is quicker and requires less skill.

ACsploit is a command-line utility that generates worst-case inputs to commonly used algorithms, such as sorting, hashing, string manipulation, etc. It is modular and highly configurable, supporting a wide variety of user-specified constraints on the generated output, allowing it to appropriately fit the requirements of the application under test. ACsploit also supports an equally wide array of output formats to assist the user in delivering the resulting exploit from ACsploit to the target system. ACsploit supports both script-driven and interactive use through a familiar Metasploit-like interface. Originally developed under the DARPA STAC program to help rapidly triage potential AC vulnerabilities, we have released ACsploit as an open source tool to the broader vulnerability researcher community.

ACsploit comes with algorithmic complexity exploits for 30+ algorithms and is easily extensible. It's designed to allow members of the community to contribute new exploit modules, input constraints, and output formatters to expand upon all aspects of its functionality. Future plans for the development of ACsploit include debugger integration and a testing framework for measuring resource usage by the targeted application.

https://github.com/govolution/bfg has been integrated

With the new architecture and features of AVET 2 you can, for example, now build an executable that is loading an encrypted .exe file via network or file, receiving the key also via network or file, decrypt in memory and then inject via process hollowing. The same applies also for other payloads like shellcode or dlls and other techniques.

### [AWSGoat : A Damn Vulnerable AWS Infrastructure](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Red--Teaming](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Red--Teaming-gray)  
Compromising an organization's cloud infrastructure is like sitting on a gold mine for attackers. And sometimes, a simple misconfiguration or a vulnerability in web applications, is all an attacker needs to compromise the entire infrastructure. Since the cloud is relatively new, many developers are not fully aware of the threatscape and they end up deploying a vulnerable cloud infrastructure. When it comes to web application pentesting on traditional infrastructure, deliberately vulnerable applications such as DVWA and bWAPP have helped the infosec community in understanding the popular web attack vectors. However, at this point in time, we do not have a similar framework for the cloud environment.

In this talk, we will be introducing AWSGoat, a vulnerable by design infrastructure on AWS featuring the latest released OWASP Top 10 web application security risks (2021) and other misconfiguration based on services such as IAM, S3, API Gateway, Lambda, EC2, and ECS. AWSGoat mimics real-world infrastructure but with added vulnerabilities. The idea behind AWSGoat is to provide security enthusiasts and pen-testers with an easy to deploy/destroy vulnerable infrastructure where they can learn how to enumerate cloud applications, identify vulnerabilities, and chain various attacks to compromise the AWS account. The deployment scripts will be open-source and made available after the talk.


### [Abusing Microsoft SQL Server with SQLRecon](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Red--Teaming](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Red--Teaming-gray)  
In November 2022, Kaspersky Lab publicly released research which outlined that reoccurring attacks against Microsoft SQL Server rose by 56% (https://usa.kaspersky.com/about/press-releases/2022_kaspersky-finds-reoccurring-attacks-using-microsoft-sql-server-rise-by-56-in-2022).

I'd like to share a tool I wrote called SQLRecon, which will demonstrate how adversaries are leveraging Microsoft SQL services to facilitate with furthering their presence within enterprise networks through privilege escalation and lateral movement. I will also share defensive considerations which organizations can practically implement to mitigate attacks. I feel that this will add a fresh perspective on the various ancillary services within enterprise Windows networks which are under less scrutiny, however still ripe for abuse.

For red team operators, SQLRecon helps address the post-exploitation tooling gap by modernizing the approach operators can take when attacking SQL Servers. The tool is written in C#, rather than long-standing existing tools that use PowerShell or Python. SQLRecon has been designed with operational security and detection avoidance in mind – with a special focus on stealth, reconnaissance, lateral movement, and privilege escalation. The tool was designed to be modular, allowing for ease of extensibility from the hacker community. SQLRecon is compatible stand-alone or within a diverse set of command and control (C2) frameworks (Cobalt Strike, Nighthawk, Mythic, PoshC2, Sliver, Havoc, etc). When using the latter, SQLRecon can be executed either in-process, or through traditional fork and run.

Furthermore, I will be releasing a new version, one that is currently only used internally on advanced red team engagements by IBM X-Force Red's Adversary Services team.

AtlasReaper is a .NET command-line tool developed for offensive security purposes, primarily focused on reconnaissance and keyword searching on Confluence and Jira instances. AtlasReaper also provides various features that are helpful for tasks such as credential farming and social engineering.

AtlasReaper was designed to be run from Command and Control (C2) to reduce the network overhead incurred from establishing a SOCKS proxy. The tool leverages Atlassian REST APIs to query metadata and content from the target Confluence and Jira. Read operations include search, listspaces, listpages, listissues, listattachments, and listusers. Any attachments that look interesting can be downloaded. It is also possible to dump all of the data for offline processing.

AtlasReaper extends its functionality with write operations, enabling users to attach files, create deceptive links, and comment on issues within Confluence or Jira. It is also contains functionality to embed images. Embedding 1x1 pixel images hosted on external servers enables stealthy NetNTLMv2 hash harvesting in Active Directory environments. The tool also facilitates targeted user engagement by @ mentioning victims on pages.

### [AttackForge.com: Giving Time Back To Pentesters - More Breaking, Less Reporting](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Red--Teaming](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Red--Teaming-gray)  
Pentesters love what they do – breaking things. But there’s no denying that Penetration Testing as a practice itself is broken. Pentesters have only few days to a) learn how an entirely new system works under the hood; b) with this knowledge, learn some more so they can figure out how to break the system; c) try countless different ways to break the system or make it do things never intended or designed by the architects and developers; then d) write an executive and technical report to explain how they did it.

It feels like an impossible task for the typical <1-week project, so why on earth would you want to become or remain a pentester? When you do this week-in week-out, add on top pressures from clients, organisational bureaucracy, worrying about utilisation, fighting Word formatting, or having to constantly justify your risk ratings – it’s no wonder pentesters get burned out – fast!

We can’t fix all of these problems, but we have found a way to take some pressure off pentesters and help make communication, collaboration, transparency and reporting much easier, and reduce some of the overheads wasted on trivial tasks which all are part of a pentest project… introducing AttackForge.com.

### [AutoRDPwn: The Shadow Attack Framework](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Red--Teaming](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Red--Teaming-gray)  
AutoRDPwn is a post-exploitation framework created in Powershell, designed primarily to automate the Shadow attack on Microsoft Windows computers. This vulnerability (catalogued as a feature by Microsoft) allows a remote attacker to view the desktop of his victim without his consent, and even control it on demand, using native tools of the operating system itself.

Thanks to the additional modules, it is possible to obtain a remote shell through Netcat, dump system hashes with Mimikatz, load a remote keylogger and much more. All this, through a totally intiutive menu in seven different languages.

In this talk, we will briefly review the most common remote desktop attacks and the big difference the Shadow attack makes to them. Afterwards, we will make different live demonstrations, in which all the functionalities of the tool will be put into practice. Some of them are the following:

- UAC, AMSI and Windows Defender Bypass
- Remote Shell using native system and third party tools
- Obtaining hashes and pass the hash
- Remote execution without credentials via SMB, WMI and WinRM
- Shadow attack on different operating systems (both desktop and server versions)
- Miscellaneous (remote keylogger, one-line execution, pivoting and more)

### [AzureGoat : A Damn Vulnerable Azure Infrastructure](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Red--Teaming](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Red--Teaming-gray)  
Microsoft Azure cloud has become the second-largest vendor by market share in the cloud infrastructure providers (as per multiple reports), just behind AWS. There are numerous tools and vulnerable applications available for AWS for the security professional to perform attack/defense practices, but it is not the case with Azure. There are far fewer options available to the community. AzureGoat is our attempt to shorten this gap.

In this talk, we will be introducing AzureGoat, a vulnerable by design infrastructure on the Azure cloud environment. AzureGoat will allow a user to do the following:

- Explore a vulnerable infrastructure hosted on an Azure account
- Exploring different ways to get a foothold into the environment, e.g., vulnerable web app, exposed endpoint, attached MSI
- Learn and practice different attacks by leveraging misconfigured Azure components like Virtual Machines, Storage Accounts, App Services, Databases, etc.
- Abusing Azure AD roles and permissions
- Auditing and fixing misconfiguration in IaC
- Redeploying the fixed/patched infrastructure

The user will be able to deploy AzureGoat on their Azure account using a pre-created Docker image and scripts. Once deployed, the AzureGoat can be used for target practice and be conveniently deleted later.

All the code and deployment scripts will be made open-source after the talk.


### [BUILDING C2 ENVIRONMENTS WITH WARHORSE](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Red--Teaming](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Red--Teaming-gray)  
Building full featured command-and-control (C2) environments can be a major undertaking, taking significant time and effort. However, deployment or proper infrastructure is key to avoiding detection and maintaining proper operational security during offensive engagements. In many instances, once a C2 environment is operational, it's utilized for a short period then destroyed. There are many different tools used within these C2 environments, with most tools requiring significant amounts of manual configuration. In recent years, API-based, on-demand cloud infrastructure has reduced the cost of building a C2 environment while also exposing functionality that encourages process automation. Combine these on-demand cloud services with the rapid development of Docker containers, and you have the building blocks to create and deploy C2 environments on the fly. Warhorse has been designed to build these C2 environments with only minimal configuration. Warhorse enables pentesters to focus on tactics instead of managing C2 infrastructure. Warhorse approaches this creation of a C2 environment with a few unique features. First, it uses a module-based approach to everything that it creates. This way, any new tactics or tools can be added as a module to utilize in creating a C2 environment. Second, Warhorse is vendor-agnostic and can be used with any cloud service provider. This allows C2 environments to live in multiple data centers and utilize multiple vendors. Lastly, Warhorse employs a two-zone approach to limit backend C2 exposure. Systems that communicate directly with the target are treated as expendable and can have very short life spans. These features combined not only help with rapid deployment but also allow pentesters to build environments with the latest tactics and techniques that can evolve on the fly and be moved whenever required.


### [Backdoor Pony: Evaluating Backdoor Attacks and Defenses in Different Domains](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Red--Teaming](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Red--Teaming-gray)  
Outsourced training and crowdsourced datasets lead to a new threat for deep
learning models: the backdoor attack. In this attack, the adversary inserts a
secret functionality in a model, activated through malicious inputs. Backdoor
attacks represent an active research area due to diverse settings where they
represent a real threat. Still, there is no framework to evaluate existing
attacks and defenses in different domains. Only a few toolboxes have been
implemented, but most of them focus on computer vision and are difficult
to use. To bridge this gap, we present Backdoor Pony, a framework for
evaluating attacks and defenses in different domains through a user-friendly
GUI.


### [Backoori: Tool Aided Persistence via Windows URI Schemes Abuse](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Red--Teaming](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Red--Teaming-gray)  
The widespread adoption of custom URI protocols to launch specific Universal App can be diverted to nefarious purposes. The URI schemes in Windows 10 can be abused in such a way to maintain persistence via fileless technique. Backdooring a compromised user (Administrator privileges not required) is a matter of seconds. The attack is transparent to the unaware victim that won't be able to identify the attack and to the antivirus solutions that are currently not monitoring the specific Registry keys involved. These subtle fileless payloads can be triggered in many contexts, from the Narrator in the Windows logon screen (a novel Accessibility Feature abuse discovered by Giulio right before deciding to implement Backoori) to the classical web attack surface. The payloads can also be dropped in gadgets that can interact between each other by abusing, once again, the Windows URI protocols.

![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Red--Teaming](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Red--Teaming-gray)  
BloodHound is a single page Javascript web application, built on top of Linkurious, compiled with Electron, with a Neo4j database fed by a PowerShell ingestor. BloodHound uses graph theory to reveal the hidden and often unintended relationships within an Active Directory environment. Attackers can use BloodHound to easily identify highly complex attack paths that would otherwise be impossible to quickly identify. Defenders can use BloodHound to identify and eliminate those same attack paths. Both blue and red teams can use BloodHound to easily gain a deeper understanding of privilege relationships in an Active Directory environment. BloodHound is developed by @_wald0, @CptJesus, and @harmj0y.

BloodHound 5.0 is faster, more powerful, and easier to deploy and use than any previous version. With this major update, we are completely overhauling BloodHound's code and bringing many features from the commercial versions of BloodHound to the free and open source version. That convergence means we can release features much faster, and that the application is much faster than it ever has been. It also means the deployment model is fundamentally changing.


Come see our Arsenal presentation to see how to set up and use BloodHound 5.0, including attack path analysis and execution demonstrations covering on-prem Active Directory and Azure.

![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Red--Teaming](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Red--Teaming-gray)  
BOtB is the first tool aimed at hackers and developers to automate Container exploitation. BOtB is a tool that can be used to analyze and identify vulnerabilities for Containers such as LXC and Docker. Not only does BOtB provide the user with a detailed analysis of identified vulnerabilities of the container, BOtB provides an autopwn feature which allows for the user to automagically exploit the vulnerabilities identified and break out onto the host. BOtB is able to identify multiple container vulnerabilities and contains a vast collection of exploits to break out of the container. BOtB is also developer friendly and has a Continuous Integration Continuous Development (CICD) mode which when enabled, BOtB will attempt to autopwn identified vulnerabilities but instead of dropping to host shells, it will return exit codes greater than 0 which is used by CICD technologies to indicate failed tests. When used in an Agile SDLC process implementing DevSecOps principles, this can assist developers with identifying Container issues prior to production deployments. BOtB is written in Golang and is distributed as a binary for multiple platforms.

![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Red--Teaming](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Red--Teaming-gray)  
Command and Control is one of the most important tactics in the MITRE ATT&CK matrix as it allows the attacker to interact with the target system and realize their objectives. Organizations leverage Cyber Threat Intelligence to understand their threat model and adversaries that have the intent, opportunity, and capability to attack. Red Team, Blue Team, and virtual Purple Teams work together to understand the adversary Tactics, ﻿Techniques, and Procedures to perform adversary emulations and improve detective and preventive controls.

The C2 Matrix was created to aggregate all the Command and Control frameworks publicly available (open-source and commercial) in a single resource to assist teams in testing their own controls through adversary emulations (Red Team or Purple Team Exercises). Phase 1 lists all the Command and Control features such as the coding language used, channels (HTTP, TCP, ﻿DNS, SMB, etc.), agents, key exchange, and other operational security features and capabilities.﻿﻿ This allows more efficient decisions making when called upon to emulate and adversary TTPs.

It is the golden age of Command and Control (C2) frameworks. Learn how these C2 frameworks work and start testing against your organization to improve detective and preventive controls.

### [CUMULUS - A CLOUD EXPLOITATION TOOLKIT](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Red--Teaming](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Red--Teaming-gray)  
There is a lack of tools for testing the security of Cloud deployments; the Cumulus Toolkit is an attack framework for exploiting the Cloud's weak points.

The Cloud enables software projects to speed up development because it allows developers to provision infrastructure and make configuration changes to their networks without much friction. This ease of deployment was but a dream in the age of the traditional datacenter. However, the Cloud also brings new attack surface which needs further exploration. Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM) services (such as Amazon's) are primary targets for attackers, as these typically control access to hundreds of API calls over many services.

Over the years there have been various discussions around cloud security, e.g., Pivoting in Amazon Clouds (2013), and few tools have been developed to enable testing the security of Cloud deployments. These tools are standalone, have not attained wide adoption, and/or have not made it into widely adopted toolkits. To fill this void, we have developed the Cumulus Toolkit. The Cumulus Toolkit is a Cloud exploitation toolkit based on the Metasploit Framework. We chose Metasploit because of its wide adoption and its wealth of existing features.

The Cumulus toolkit is a set of modules that can be used perform privilege escalation, account takeover, and to launch unauthorized workloads. To illustrate security concerns resulting from lax IAM policies, we present the Create IAM User module which can be used to create a user with administrative privileges. To perform complete account takeover, an attack that we've seen in the wild, we present the User Locker module which is used to lock out all legitimate users out of the account. Finally, we present the Launch Instances module which can be used to launch Cloud hosts on demand.

### [Codecepticon - One Obfuscator to Rule Them All](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Red--Teaming](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Red--Teaming-gray)  
Codecepticon is an obfuscator that works with C#, PowerShell, and VBA (macros), and has been battle-tested for the last 1.5yr against modern ERD and AV technologies with great success. It supports a variety of obfuscation techniques such as renaming classes, and functions, rewriting strings and the tool's command line arguments, and even generating "English sounding" variable names using Markov chains. Instead of targeting compiled executables/assemblies, it focuses on the source code and utilizes Roslyn for C#, PS Automation for PowerShell, and ANTLR for VBA, in order to achieve the best possible result.


### [CoffeeShot: Avoid Detection with Memory Injection](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Red--Teaming](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Red--Teaming-gray)  
For the first time ever, we are introducing a framework that utilizes the usage of Java Native Access with Java. How did we take advantage of that? Well, we used this to call to interesting Windows API's directly from Java. CoffeeShot is a framework that was designed for creating Java-based malware which bypasses most of the anti-virus vendors. CoffeeShot utilizes the features of JNA to look for a victim process, once it finds it - a shellcode will be injected directly from the Java Archive file (JAR).

Java malware like "Jrat" and "Adwind" are used by malicious adversaries day by day, more and more. Their main reason for writing malware in Java is to be evasive and avoid security products – including those that use advanced features like machine learning. To overcome the above, blue-teamers can use this framework and thereby understand their status of anti-malware weakness against Java-based malware.

On the other hand, CoffeeShot can be applied by penetration testers as well. The framework provides red-teamers a friendly toolset by allowing them to embed any shellcode in a JAR file, assisting them to avoid detection with memory injection and to PWN the target!

### [Covenant: .NET Command and Control](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Red--Teaming](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Red--Teaming-gray)  
Covenant is a .NET command and control platform and web application that aims to highlight the attack surface of the .NET Framework and .NET Core, make the use of offensive .NET tradecraft easier, and serve as a collaborative platform for red teamers.

Covenant is multi-platform, multi-user, provides an intuitive web application interface, and is extendible through an API.

Covenant includes multiple built-in implants that utilize the traditional .NET Framework and .NET Core, which gives Covenant multi-platform implants that run on Windows, Linux, and MacOS. Additionally, Covenant allows operators to edit and add additional custom implants.

Covenant includes built-in support for custom and complex command and control routing. The platform includes built-in outbound listeners, including an HTTP and TCP listener, and peer-to-peer SMB communications over named pipes, which allows for complex implant networking. The platform also includes a protocol for adding new, custom communication protocols that gives the operator complete control over how the command and control traffic appears on the wire.

Covenant includes tons of built-in tasks based on libraries such as SharpSploit and GhostPack, and uses dynamic C# compilation and ConfuserEx obfuscation on tasks and payloads.

Covenant also has an emphasis on implant and network communication security to protect the data accessed by implants. Covenant implements an Encrypted Key Exchange protocol between implants and listeners to achieve forward secrecy for new implants and enforces SSL certificate pinning for implants.

In the age of EDR and threat hunting, red teamers need flexible, robust, and intuitive command and control platforms. Red teamers need the ability to collaborate with teammates, customize implant behavior and command and control traffic, track artifacts, and quickly adapt for defensive technologies. In this demo, you'll be shown how to accomplish this with Covenant.


### [CuddlePhish: Bypassing MFA on Nearly Impenetrable Web Portals](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Red--Teaming](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Red--Teaming-gray)  
With the increased adoption of multi-factor authentication, traditional credential harvesting attacks are quickly losing effectiveness. Instead, redteamers have shifted focus away from credential harvesting and are now focussing on session hijacking attacks. Popular redteaming tools like Evilginx2 use transparent proxies to collect both credential AND session cookies from phishing targets. But what if the target service uses more advanced authentication flows like Oauth or SAML? What about apps that use JavaScript to directly thwart MitM attacks? Or even worse, services that don't grant authorization through session cookies at all? Our team has seen many instances of MitM protections like these, and in response, we are raising the bar for session hijacking tradecraft. Instead of using a transparent proxy, our solution leverages browser automation to force target users to log us into services for them. We don't just get to view the traffic. We get full control of an authenticated browser tab. Our solution, CuddlePhish, allows operators to bypass MFA even when MitM protections are in place, target multiple users simultaneously, key log users' credentials, trigger arbitrary javascript on victims' browsers to either redirect them or deliver payloads, and hijack not just session cookies, but authenticated browser tabs themselves. We have successfully used this attack against extremely difficult portals like Gmail and Lastpass.

The DSInternals PowerShell Module exposes many internal and undocumented security-related features of Active Directory. It is included in FireEye's Commando VM and its cmdlets can be used in the following scenarios:

- Active Directory password auditing that discovers accounts sharing the same passwords or having passwords in a public database like HaveIBeenPwned.
- Offline ntds.dit file manipulation, password resets, group membership changes, SID History injection and enabling/disabling accounts.
- Bare-metal recovery of domain controllers from just IFM backups (ntds.dit + SYSVOL).
- Online password hash dumping through the Directory Replication Service Remote Protocol (MS-DRSR).
- Domain or local account password hash injection, either through the Security Account Manager Remote Protocol (MS-SAMR) or by directly modifying the database.
- LSA Policy modification through the Local Security Authority Remote Protocol (MS-LSAD / LSARPC).
- Extracting credential roaming data and DPAPI domain backup keys, either online through directory replication and LSARPC, or offline from ntds.dit files.

![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Red--Teaming](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Red--Teaming-gray)  
This presentation covers the design and implementation of the Docker Security Playground (DSP), an architecture leveraging a microservices-based approach in order to build complex network infrastructures specifically tailored to the study of network security. DSP has been conceived at the outset as a tool for learning network security with a hands-on approach. A number of security labs have been already realized and made available in a public repository. The talk discusses how such labs can be fruitfully exploited by students, as well as presents the Application Programming Interface offered to programmers interested in the implementation of new labs.


### [DeepSea Phishing Gear](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Red--Teaming](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Red--Teaming-gray)  
Introducing DeepSea, the phishing gear you will want to take with you on your next offensive expedition. 

It is designed to help Red Team operators and teams with the tactical delivery of opsec-tight, flexible email phishing campaigns carried out in a portable manner on the outside as well as on the inside 
of a perimeter. 

Have you ever wanted to seamlessly operate with external and internal email providers; quickly re-target connectivity parameters per campaign; flexibly add headers, targets, attachments, correctly format and inline email templates, images and multipart messages; use content templates for personalization; clearly separate artifacts and content delivery for multiple (parallel or sequential) phishing campaigns; get actionable context help and deploy with minimal dependencies? 

In this session, we will show how you can do this and more in a portable, one binary cross platform setup, with less than 50 lines in a configuration file. 

With DeepSea, you will be able to keep campaign persistence with DNS tricks and an embedded email server used for running advanced two-way threaded campaigns you have always wanted. Catch and respond to those often missed inquiry emails, solidifying pretext and pacifying your marks.

Whether you plan on executing phishing campaigns deep on the inside of the perimeter, or bounce across multiple email providers for an external stealthy campaign delivery, DeepSea is very likely able to help.


### [Democratizing Attack Techniques in the Cloud withThe DeRF](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Red--Teaming](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Red--Teaming-gray)  
DeRF (Detection Replay Framework) is an "Attacks As A Service" framework, allowing the emulation of offensive techniques and generation of repeatable detection samples from a UI - without the need for End Users to install software, use the CLI or possess credentials in the target environment.

Notable built-in attack modules are listed below with a complete list of all built-in attack techniques in The DeRF documentation.

o AWS | EC2 Steal Instance Credentials
o AWS | Retrieve a High Number of Secrets Manager secrets.
o AWS | Stop CloudTrail
o AWS | Execute Commands on EC2 Instance via User Data
o AWS | EC2 Download User Data
o AWS | EC2 Share EBS Snapshot
o GCP | Impersonate Service Account

Similar to other tools focused on detection generation, the DeRF deploys and manages the target cloud infrastructure, which is manipulated to simulate attacker techniques.
Terraform is used to manage all resources, deploying (and destroying) hosted attack techniques and target infrastructure in under 3 minutes.

While a bring-your-own-Infrastructure (BYOI) model isn't currently supported, maintaining The DeRF infrastructure costs less than $10/month for Google Cloud and $5/month for AWS. The tool's convenient deployment model means you can use it as needed rather than continuously running 24/7. Check out the deployment guide for more details.

The initial release of The DeRF encompasses a wide range of prevalent cloud attack techniques, providing your organization with ample resources for training, controls testing, and executing on attack scenarios. However, as needs evolve, you may need to expand beyond the initial set and introduce your own custom attack modules. With The DeRF, this process is simplified. All attack techniques are defined as Google Cloud Workflows, which can be deployed as additional terraform modules within your forked version of the codebase.


### [Docker Exploitation Framework](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Red--Teaming](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Red--Teaming-gray)  
Docker Exploitation Framework is a cross-platform framework that is focused on attacking container environment (think kubernetes, docker etc). It can identify vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and potential attack vectors. It also helps to automate different stages of a successful kill-chain through features such as:
- Vulnerability Scanning
- Container breakouts
- Pod2Pod Lateral movement
- File layers deep inspection and extraction
- Attack Surface discovery and mapping
- Privilege Escalation etc

It uses a agent/server architecture. The agents are modular and are designed to be portable with minimal dependencies for maximum compatibility in restricted containers. This is a tool created for pentesters and red teamers.

![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Red--Teaming](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Red--Teaming-gray)  
Docker Security Playground is an architecture leveraging a microservices-based approach in order to build complex network infrastructures specifically tailored to the study of network security. The idea is to leverage latest fashion virtualization techniques in order to: (i) reproduce real-world networking scenarios; (ii) build ad-hoc network playgrounds involving vulnerable nodes/services and malicious users/tools; (iii) provide lab participants with low-cost, COTS-based, easily reproducible networking tools.


### [Dragnmove: Infect Shared Files In Memory for Lateral Movement](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Red--Teaming](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Red--Teaming-gray)  
People share files with each other every day using different applications like email clients, chat applications, browsers, etc. These channels are commonly used for lateral movement usually in the context of internal phishing. Dragnmove tool provides a different approach to abuse file sharing in order to move laterally in the target environment. Dragnmove can be used to inject payloads into the files that are being sent without touching the files in the file system.

The tool works on Windows targets and can be executed as Beacon Object File (BOF) or Reflective DLL in order to work with various C2 servers. Dragnmove injects itself into the target processes that the attacker chooses and waits for the user to drag a file into this process or attach a file to it.

When a compromised user starts the sharing process, Dragnmove can modify files in memory to inject the attacker's payload into the shared files by hooking the Windows mechanisms used by actions like "drag and drop" or "attach file". This method provides a better opportunity for the attackers to get their payloads executed in the lateral targets because the files sent will be relevant to the targets' contexts. Since the context and sender are relevant, it is more possible that the target sees this file as trustable and opens it. Dragnmove can also be used in environments where the targets are working in different locations or in isolated networks (like working from home) so the usual lateral movement methods cannot be utilized.


### [Dynamic Labs: Windows & Active Directory Exploitation](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Red--Teaming](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Red--Teaming-gray)  
If you are after red-team training, there are multiple excellent courses and online resources for practising adversary simulation. That's not the primary motivation behind Alfa labs.

Alfa labs allows:
- Blue/red teamers to test or demonstrate specific attacks/attack-paths (e.g. when GMSA edges were introduced into BloodHound).
- Beginners to take a structured approach to learning Active Directory weaknesses (which have largely been practically accessible if you build your own lab, during workshops w/ limited spaces or commercial training).
- Replicate any technical issues and confirm your results

Therefore, stop by and spin up your own lab to practise your Windows Active Directory tools, techniques and procedures (TTPs) in isolation, or red-team your way through the dynamically-built Alfa labs.


### [Echidna: Penetration Test Assist & Collaboration Tool](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Red--Teaming](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Red--Teaming-gray)  
Echidna is a tool designed to support teams or beginners in conducting penetration testing.
While there are many tools available to assist or automate penetration testing, mastering them requires knowledge of numerous commands and techniques, making it challenging for beginners to learn and carry out penetration testing. Furthermore, when conducting penetration tests in a team, each member tends to work independently, which can lead to duplication of work and lack of visibility of progress for managers and beginners.
Therefore, we developed Echidna, which visualizes and shares the terminal console of penetration testers, and recommends the next command based on each situation.


### [ElfPack: ELF Binary Section Docking in Stageless Payload Delivery](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Red--Teaming](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Red--Teaming-gray)  
When it comes to generating and delivering malware on Linux, offensive operators have choices. Some objectives call for a dynamic payload bootstrap off the wire, others require stageless implants.

Often, malware deployed with bundled payloads can be successfully detected and analyzed. However, we think there are opportunities to improve on the process of embedding payloads in standalone implants that can elevate their survival levels.

ElfPack is one such development in the static payload embedding and loading tailored for adversary simulation teams. In our demo we will demonstrate the mechanisms of construction of ELF binaries, focusing on how ELFPack can use sections facilitate a successful stealthy payload hosting, retrieval and loading.

We will show the concept of ELF section docking, whereby a section containing payload can be independently attached to the payload-agnostic loader. We will further expand the concept to address in-field (re-)attachment of sections to loaders without the use of compilers which may be very useful for long-haul offensive operations.

Furthermore, we will show how ElfPack can be successfully used as an alternative to executable packing when addressing complex payloads and providing teams with options and flexibility in multiple payload delivery scenarios.

We will demonstrate both detection opportunities and the enhanced evasion features implemented in a ElfPack proof-of-concept loader and injector tooling.

We feel that ElfPack and section docking in general can help solve some of the payload bundling challenges for the offensive operators, and also introduce ideas to hunters to detect and respond to this technique.

EntraID guest accounts are widely used to grant external parties limited access to enterprise resources, with the assumption that these accounts pose little security risk. As you're about to see, this assumption is dangerously wrong.

powerpwn is an offensive security toolset for Microsoft 365 focused on Power Platform. It allows you to achieve the full potential of a guest in EntraID by exploiting a series of undocumented internal APIs and common misconfiguration for collecting privileges, and using those for data exfiltration and actions on target, leaving no traces behind. The tool operates by leveraging shared credentials shared over Power Platform, a low-code / no-code platform built into Office365.

PowerGuest allows gaining unauthorized access to sensitive business data and capabilities including corporate SQL servers and Azure resources. Furthermore, it allows guests to create and control internal business applications to move laterally within the organization. All capabilities are fully operational with the default Office 365 and Azure AD configuration.


### [EvilnoVNC: Next-Gen Spear Phishing Attacks](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Red--Teaming](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Red--Teaming-gray)  
One of the main attack vectors in Red Team exercises, and possible entry points for an attacker, are phishing campaigns.

Currently, there are all kinds of tools and countermeasures to perform or defend against them, with a very high level of maturity and fully consolidated by the industry for many years.

On the other hand, there are hardly any tools oriented to Spear Phishing or any other type of more sophisticated attack, regardless of whether you are part of the Red Team or the Blue Team.

In this presentation, and from a totally offensive approach, we will explain how it has been possible to develop a new tool aimed at Spear Phishing, which will use techniques never seen before for this purpose, allowing us to see what the victim is doing in real time, intercept keystrokes with a keylogger, obtain and decrypt cookies, among many other things.

### [Foxtrot C2: A Journey of Payload Delivery](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Red--Teaming](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Red--Teaming-gray)  
Execution of an offensive payload may begin with a safe delivery of the payload to the endpoint itself. When secure connections in the enterprise are inspected, reliance only on transmission level security may not be enough to accomplish that goal. Foxtrot C2 serves one goal: safe last mile delivery of payloads and commands between the external network and the internal point of presence, traversing intercepting proxies, with the end-to-end application level encryption.

While the idea of end-to-end application encryption is certainly not new, the exact mechanism of Foxtrot's delivery implementation has advantages to Red Teams as it relies on a well known third party site, enjoying elevated ranking and above average domain fronting features. Payload delivery involves several OpSec defenses: sensible protection from direct attribution, active link expiration to evade consistent interception, inspection, tracking and replay activities by the defenders. Asymmetric communication channels are also planned.

And if your standalone Foxtrot agent is caught, the delivery mechanism may live on, you could still manually bring the agent back into the environment via the browser. A concept tool built on these ideas will be presented and released. It will be used as basis for our discussion.


### [FumbleChain: A Purposefully Vulnerable Blockchain](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Red--Teaming](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Red--Teaming-gray)  
FumbleChain is a deliberately insecure blockchain designed to raise awareness about blockchain security. Cryptocurrencies and blockchains are still relatively new, and there have been plenty of news stories about people losing money through compromises in various components making up a blockchain ecosystem. FumbleChain hopes to bridge the awareness gap in a fun way, one in which nobody loses money.

FumbleChain allows people to test their skills attacking the chain and store running on top. The FumbleStore is a CTF in the form of a fake e-commerce web application that offers products you can buy using FumbleCoins, which is the ecosystem's cryptocurrency. Purchasing new products requires players to exploit flaws and steal coins from crypto-wallets. Of course, you could mine coins and use the system legitimately, but where's the fun in that?

The project is written in Python making it easy for anyone to read and modify its source code. It's also modular, making it easy to hack and add new challenges. The entire project is fully dockerized, letting anyone play with FumbleChain in a quick and hassle-free way.


### [GCP Scanner](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Red--Teaming](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Red--Teaming-gray)  
Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is a rapidly growing cloud infrastructure with millions of customers worldwide and more than a hundred of various products offered to them. While Cloud offers undeniable benefits in scalability, performance and security, it also opens new and unique challenges for security engineers working with Cloud. One such challenge is credential management.

Cloud credentials such as GCP service account (SA) key can open access to the most critical parts of cloud infrastructure. An incorrectly stored or leaked SA key with such permissions represents high interest for an attacker. Security engineers need to understand the impact of such key leak/compromise to draft a proper security response.

The main objective of GCP Scanner is to offer the community a tool that can be used to evaluate the security impact of a given cloud identity compromise. Security engineers can use this tool to assess the impact of a certain credentials leak, OAuth2 token, potential compromise of a GCP VM or Kubernetes pod.

By now, the only option available was to rely on heavy-weight solutions or time-consuming manual analysis that require privileged access to the affected GCP organization. In contrast, the GCP Scanner works with individual credentials and offers an easy-to-use solution that can be executed from various types of environments with just a single command.

In the demo, we will talk about the scanner architecture and show the audience on how to use the tool in various types of situations (leaked GCP service account key, compromised end-user credentials, VMs and Docker containers, standalone binary from any machine). We will also cover how the scanner can be used to evaluate whether a GCP SA key can be used to impersonate other service accounts and understand potential impact.

### [GodPotato: As Long as You Have the ImpersonatePrivilege Permission, Then You are the SYSTEM!](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Red--Teaming](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Red--Teaming-gray)  
Based on the history of Potato privilege escalation for 6 years, from the beginning of RottenPotato to the end of JuicyPotatoNG, I discovered a new technology by researching DCOM, which enables privilege escalation in Windows 2012 - Windows 2022, now as long as you have "ImpersonatePrivilege" permission. Then you are "NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM", usually WEB services and database services have "ImpersonatePrivilege" permissions.



Potato privilege escalation is usually used when we obtain WEB/database privileges. We can elevate a service user with low privileges to "NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM" privileges.
However, the historical Potato has no way to run on the latest Windows system. When I was researching DCOM, I found a new method that can perform privilege escalation. There are some defects in rpcss when dealing with oxid, and rpcss is a service that must be opened by the system. , so it can run on almost any Windows OS, I named it GodPotato


### [HIDE & SEEK: An Open Source Implant for Red Teams](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Red--Teaming](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Red--Teaming-gray)  
Many Enterprises are shifting away from dedicated workstations and cubes, and moving to a more flexible workspace with thin client and desk hoteling. This creates the ideal landscape for hardware implant attacks. The current implant market, as it exists today, has not kept up with this shift. While closed source for-profit solutions exist, by their nature they lack the flexibility and customization to adapt to large scale targeted deployments. Open source projects similarly exist but focus more on individual workstations (dumb keyboards and remote terminals) relying on corporate networks for remote control and are easily detectable. Neither solution today is able to meet the needs of a modern Red Team.
This presentation introduces an open source, freely available hardware implant which adopts modern IoT technologies, leveraging non-standard communication channels to create a remotely managed mesh network of hardware implants. Attendees will learn about the new techniques and tactics that we used to create a new breed of open-source hardware implant. Topics covered in this presentation will include the scaling of implants for a stealthy enterprise takeover, creating and utilizing a flexible command and control mesh network, creating a new class of remote access shells that survive idle screen lock, and more. Attendees will leave the talk with new tactics and a new platform from which to innovate their own custom implants from. Live demos will be used to demonstrate these new tactics against real world infrastructure.
Previous hardware implant talks have covered: basic implants, their benefits, injecting keystrokes, Wi-Fi connectivity, and attack scripts. This presentation builds off of those but shows attendees how to leverage new techniques and technologies to push the innovation of hardware implants forward evolutionarily for use in today's modern Red Team operations.


### [Haaukins: A Highly Accessible and Automated Virtualization Platform for Security Education](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Red--Teaming](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Red--Teaming-gray)  
Haaukins is a highly accessible platform for security education, which allows users to try out ethical hacking and penetration testing using Kali Linux through a browser. It makes it possible to conduct trainings for even large groups without the need for installing virtual environments or other tools – the participants can work on their own laptops just through their web browser of choice, and have access within a couple of minutes.

Haaukins allows the teacher/instructor to set up an event using a command line interface specifying e.g. which challenges to include and how many labs are needed. Labs can include different kind of challenges, such as a number of vulnerable machines. The challenges can also include e.g. sniffing network traffic between different machines. Once an event is setup, users/teams can easily register and see the challenges as in any CTF.

What makes Haaukins stand out is that each user is assigned a virtual lab, which is accessed through a Kali Linux accessible through a web browser. After registration, the user just clicks the "connect" button, and he can access the Kali Linux desktop.

Haaukins is designed with training in mind rather than for competition. For this reason a number of features are implemented such as Dynamic Flags, so the teams cannot exchange flags between each other, and a randomization of IP addresses throughout the challenges, so teams really have to work their own way through.

It is easy to contribute with new challenges, since challenges can consist of any set of docker images and VirtualBox OVA's.

During the last year, the platform has been tested out with different target audiences, including OWASP groups, networks of IT professionals, companies, high schools and higher education.


### [HardeningMeter](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Red--Teaming](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Red--Teaming-gray)  
HardeningMeter is an open-source Python tool carefully designed to comprehensively assess the security hardening of binaries and systems. Its robust capabilities include thorough checks of various binary exploitation protection mechanisms, including Stack Canary, RELRO, randomizations (ASLR, PIC, PIE), None Exec Stack, Fortify, ASAN, NX bit. This tool is suitable for all types of binaries and provides accurate information about the hardening status of each binary, identifying those that deserve attention and those with robust security measures.

The genesis of HardeningMeter stems from extensive research into the dynamic cat-and-mouse game between attackers and defenders when exploiting binaries. While certain binary hardening measures are designed to thwart binary exploitation, resourceful attackers continue to find ways to circumvent these protections. HardeningMeter is a wake-up call that raises awareness of the critical need to protect against binary exploitation, monitors vulnerable binaries that lack critical hardening, and promotes a broader understanding of the offensive research landscape.

HardeningMeter's uniqueness lies in its precision, which is based on a deep understanding of binary structures, exploitation techniques, and hardening mechanisms. It supports all binary file types, including executables, dynamic executables, dynamic shared objects, relocatables, and statically linked files.

The tool offers a significant benefit to users, each check that the tool performs is documented in detail to allow users to dive into the inner workings of binary hardening. Users can gain a deeper understanding of the underlying concepts, explore the intricacies of binary exploitation protection mechanisms, and expand their knowledge in this important area. Moreover, users can set the output to receive tailored recommendations on which binary files require heightened attention and monitoring.

We hope to contribute to the cybersecurity community and benefit from their ideas and perceptions to extend our features and make HardeningMeter a better tool that supports systems other than Linux in the future.

The hyperconnected world is a reality nowadays. Today, we should consider that companies have a considerable number of these devices within their workplaces or offices. With the famous BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) companies are opening an attack vector that can be exposed or increased by the different devices that employees can carry to the office, either on their body, on a keyring, in their backpack or even on their clothes. The many different technologies that can be used are a vector attack for assailants and Red Team members.

The emergence of millions of devices, from different nature, have caused changes in the security applied for each of them. Using several technologies between these devices makes security heterogeneous. Bluetooth Low-Energy, WiFi, NFC are just some examples of the technologies being used by millions of devices around our society. Most of them can be found at home or in our offices. Companies are suffering many attacks that can come through a wrong configuration and can be used by an attacker to gain access to other resources within the company itself. HomePwn is a framework that provides several features for auditing and pentesting on devices connected to the Internet using different technologies such: WiFi, Bluetooth Low-Energy, or NFC, among others.

![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Red--Teaming](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Red--Teaming-gray)  
Kubernetes Goat is an interactive Kubernetes security learning playground. It has intentionally vulnerable by design scenarios to showcase the common misconfigurations, real-world vulnerabilities, and security issues in Kubernetes clusters, containers, and cloud native environments.

It's tough to learn and understand Kubernetes security safely, practically, and efficiently. So here we come to solve this problem not only for security researchers but also to showcase how we can leverage it for attackers, defenders, developers, DevOps teams, and anyone interested in learning Kubernetes security. We are also helping products & vendors to showcase their product or tool's effectiveness by using these playground scenarios and also help them to use this to educate their customers and organizations. This project is a place to share knowledge with the community in well-documented quality content in hands-on scenario approaches.


### [Introducing subCrawl: A Framework for the Analysis and Clustering of Hacking Tools Found Using Open Directories](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Red--Teaming](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Red--Teaming-gray)  
From phishing kits to command-and-control panels, web shells and multiple samples of malware, open directories can provide a wealth of information into threat actor operations. But how can we discover open directories? And once we discover them, what are the next steps for identifying interesting content?

To answer these questions, we created the open-source framework subCrawl. subCrawl is written in Python3 and provides a modular framework for discovering open directories, unique content through signatures and organizing the data with optional output modules, such as MISP.

Open directories are simply folders that are viewable on a public web server that provides direct links to all its content. While open directories can be used to legitimately share files, they are often overlooked by threat actors. Therefore, they can provide insight into the structure, tools and malware being used by many threat actors. This oversight can provide direct access to the tools they've placed on a server, such as web shells, C2 panels or proxy scripts.

To organize the data, we use our framework subCrawl to aggregate the data with fuzzy hashes, web server information, used scripting languages and more. This approach allows for the creation of signatures that can be used to track tool usage across multiple hosts and cluster threat actor activities. To help manage the hosts explored and the data collected, we create consolidated MISP events, which enables us to cluster the found artifacts and draw interesting conclusions about the use of tools.

We will present the open-source framework subCrawl, which reflects our approach for hunting open directories. We will also explore our methodology to detect and cluster malicious content using publicly available threat feeds with the support of the well-known tool MISP, which helps us to store the data in a structured form and cluster it.


### [Invoke-AntiVM: A Powershell Module for VM Evasion](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Red--Teaming](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Red--Teaming-gray)  
Recently, attackers have been using living off the land tools such as Powershell and the community has developed a large arsenal based on it such as - just to mention a few - PowerSploit, Invoke-Mimikatz, Powerup, Nishang,Powershell Empire, Invoke-Obfuscation and recently Covenant.

With so many options available to attackers Windows has introduced advanced Powershell logging capabilities and the AMSI interface.

This is not enough however because the attackers have started to use VM detections within their payload to thwart analysis, one needs to remember that powershell script logging only de-obfuscate the functions that have been executed.

Therefore we wrote a powershell module with a set of functions that an attacker or a pentester can import in their powershell implant to decide whether the target is a sandbox VM or possibly a real target. In addition to the techniques used in Nishang (Check-VM) which are mostly based on signatures of specific registry keys and process names, we have used a more general – and behavioral – approach which includes all the information from the OS including for example how many programs are installed, what screenshot is used, what network cards are installed, what is the history usage of certain applications such as explorer or word etc. etc.

We have also added a fingerprinting module which can be included into a word document for example that once is run collects key metrics from the running OS and reports them into a pastebin account or gmail account, after being compressed and encrypted. Once on pastsebin the attacker can download the exfiltrated profile via a python script and decode for further analysis. We are also building a simple machine learning module that given enough data points is able to infer the decision boundary to determine if a host is a VM or not in addition or in replacement of setting manual thresholds.

This is a pretty powerful recon technique for red-team pentesting because in most cases the sandbox will execute the incoming attached documents (if they contain macros for example) thus allowing the exfiltration of the VM data. This can then be used to tweak the payload to avoid the specific sandbox solution and to make sure the malicious payload is run into a real target.

We developed this tool to increase awareness of recent techniques for the reverser community. It includes a full readme that explains how can be just in conjunction with Invoke-Obfuscation, Invoke-Cradle and the MaliciousMacroGenerator. We are also periodically running the fingerprinting service to provide profiles for popular online services such as HybridAnalysis, AnyRun, CuckooSandbox as well desktop solutions such as Qemu, VirtualBox, and VMWare.

![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Red--Teaming](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Red--Teaming-gray)  
Koadic is a post-exploitation toolkit that leverages the Windows Script Host, delivering all the features expected from a modern RAT via VBScript/JScript. Koadic was first released at DEF CON in 2017, and has since seen two years of development. Koadic is robust enough to have been chosen in nation-state cyberespionage campaigns by APT favorites such as Fancy Bear, Stone Panda, and MuddyWater. It has been the tool of choice on the road to domain admin for many pentests, especially in environments where PowerShell and filesystems are heavily audited by antivirus.

New payloads have been added since release, such as Squiblytwo WMIC.exe XSL files (discovered by SubTee and Mattifestation) and Bitsadmin.exe transfer jobs. Existing payloads have been upgraded to include obfuscation and antivirus evasion.

Several new implants have been added, including UAC bypasses via slui, fodhelper, compmgmtlauncher, and compdefaults. A loot finder module automates the process of finding files which may contain sensitive data. Persistence is now available via registry autoruns, WMI, and scheduled tasks. "One shot" stagers now allow an implant to be run immediately on a zombies first call home.

A new credential storage feature has been added, transforming Mimikatz outputs acquired into a readily searchable format. A full fledged API is also available, allowing all available functionality of the toolkit to be automated through HTTP interactions. There are innumerable bug fixes, improvements to reliability, and additional stealth since the initial release, with new features being added regularly.


### [Konstellation: RBACpacking in Kubernetes](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Red--Teaming](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Red--Teaming-gray)  
Konstellation is a new open-source tool that simplifies Kubernetes role-based access control (RBAC) data collection and security analysis. Kubernetes RBAC is a powerful tool to manage access to resources, but its complexity increases exponentially as principals and resources grow, making it challenging to analyze the resulting data at scale. Konstellation uses graph theory to map and analyze all Kubernetes resources and RBAC permissions, which simplifies analysis of RBAC implementations for security vulnerabilities.

Konstellation allows engineers to understand what actions principals are allowed to perform on resources, analyze complex relationships not visible in native Kubernetes or other tools, and find overprovisioning and privilege escalation paths. Additionally, Konstellation is configuration-driven, allowing for quick adaptation to different environments, configurations, and analysis needs.

The tool features three primary modes: enumeration, data ingestion, and querying. The enumeration mode connects directly to a Kubernetes cluster, enumerates each resource type returned by the API server, and writes the results to files in JSON format. Alternatively, Konstellation can ingest kubectl JSON output.

Konstellation is schema-less and uses structured output from enumeration to determine data structures. Every resource instance and its attributes map into a Neo4j node with node properties. Users can query all enumerated resource data from the schema without data loss. After ingesting the resource instances, Konstellation maps relationships using Neo4j cypher queries defined in its configuration.

Query mode allows for rapid data analysis. Konstellation ships with 40+ queries that look for privilege escalation paths and known vulnerable configurations. Users also can perform ad-hoc queries through command line or directly in Neo4j.

Analyzing Kubernetes RBAC weaknesses at scale can be daunting, but Konstellation offers a clear overview of RBAC implementations and simplifies the process of identifying security vulnerabilities.


### [Kube-Hunter: Pentest Platform for Kubernetes Environments](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Red--Teaming](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Red--Teaming-gray)  
Kubernetes is today's most popular container orchestrator. But it's also a complex distributed system, with defaults tuned for usability rather than for security. More so, configuring Kubernetes correctly is not trivial. Failing to configure Kubernetes in a secure way exposes the applications running on it to imminent risk, regardless of how securely those application are built.

We recognized the need to assess the level of security of a Kubernetes cluster deployment, and built kube-hunter to be an extensible pentesting and risk assessment platform for Kubernetes environments. We contributed quite a few discovery and hunt techniques from the get-go, and will add more over time. Kube-hunter is also designed to be easily extended by the community. The full list is too long for 300 words and ever-growing. This is the list of newest tests:
Newest Passive Tests (tests not making any change to the cluster):
● Vulnerabilities hunter (added CVEs):
○ CVE-2019-9512
○ CVE-2019-9514
○ CVE-2019-11247
○ CVE-2019-11246
○ CVE-2019-1002101
● Hunt pods that have write access to host's /var/log. Potentially allows an attacker to read files on the host machine
● Checks for default enabled capabilities in a pod

Newest Active Tests (may perform state-changing actions on the cluster):
● Checks for the possibility of running an ARP spoof attack from within a pod
● Checks for the possibility for a malicious pod to compromise DNS requests of the cluster

### [MAILSNIPER](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Red--Teaming](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Red--Teaming-gray)  
Oftentimes, on penetration tests we find ourselves having elevated access (Domain Admin) within an organization. One of the best ways to demonstrate risk to an organization is to show the ability to gain access to sensitive data. Email is often the primary messaging system inside most organizations and is the go-to medium for simple chit-chat about daily business, password resets, or even corporate strategy.

MailSniper is a PowerShell-based penetration testing tool whose primary purpose is to search through email in a Microsoft Exchange environment for specific terms (i.e. passwords, insider intel, network architecture information, etc.). It can be used as a non-administrative user to search their own email, or by an Exchange administrator to search the mailboxes of every user in a domain.

MailSniper includes additional modules for attacking externally-facing Outlook Web Access (OWA) and Exchange Web Services (EWS) portals. With MailSniper, it is also possible to: perform password spraying attacks, enumerate internal domain names and usernames, locate inboxes with too broad permissions, and gather the Global Address List containing all email addresses of users at an organization from OWA and EWS.


### [MUSHIKAGO-femto: Automated Pentest & First Aid Tool for IT/OT Environments](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Red--Teaming](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Red--Teaming-gray)  
At the Black Hat USA 2021 Arsenal, we presented MUSHIKAGO, an automated penetration testing tool for both IT and OT. MUSHIKAGO can automatically perform penetration tests and post-exploitation in various environments without prior learning.

This time, we have newly evolved MUSHIKAGO as MUSHIKAGO-femto, incorporating cutting-edge features. The evolution includes the implementation of a mechanism to perform first aid on the tested system and acquire immune functions so that the same attack can be defended against attacks that could be achieved by penetration tests. A function was implemented to defend against vulnerability attacks by applying patches, injecting FW functions or proprietary IPS into terminals. Specifically, taking advantage of the fact that the penetration test was able to penetrate the system, patches are applied as if injecting a vaccine at the penetrated terminal, or a unique thin IPS is incorporated. This allows the system to be defended before the actual attacker can exploit the vulnerability or misconfiguration. Based on these results, MUSHIKAGO-femto has become the Next-Generation Pentest Tool that strengthens system defenses while performing penetration testing.

Other additional features include the implementation of a scan function to detect ICS protocols in order to detect ICS devices with high accuracy. MUSHIKAGO-femto has both Active Scan and Passive Scan functions, enabling comprehensive detection of PLCs and ICS devices. This enables automatic penetration of OT system. This makes it possible to perform automatic penetration tests on OT system with high accuracy. In the demo, we will show how it can perform automatic penetration testing and automatic protection against Hack THe Box and VulnHub machines. We will also show that it is possible to perform effective penetration testing in our OT/ICS environment.

Active Directory is the foundation of the infrastructure for many organizations. As of 2023, Metasploit has added a wide range of new capabilities and attack workflows to support Active Directory exploitation. This Arsenal demonstration will cover new ways to enumerate information from LDAP, attacking Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS), leveraging Role Based Constrained Delegation, and using Kerberos authentication.

The Kerberos features added in Metasploit 6.3 will be a focal point. The audience will learn how to execute multiple attack techniques, including Pass-The-Ticket (PTT), forging Golden/Silver Tickets, and authenticating with AD CS certificates. Finally, users will see how these attack primitives can be combined within Metasploit to streamline attack workflows with integrated ticket management. The demonstration will also highlight inspection capabilities that are useful for decrypting traffic and tickets for debugging and research purposes.


### [Mushikago: IT and OT Automation Penetration Tool Using Game AI](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Red--Teaming](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Red--Teaming-gray)  
Penetration testing is an effective means of discovering vulnerabilities and inadequate settings in the overall system, and of investigating whether there are any operational security risks. However, in manual penetration testing, there are many cases where it is unclear whether the test content is really appropriate, because the diagnosis varies depending on the tester's strong and weak, interests, physical condition, and mental state on that day. Also, excellent testers are already booked by a large amount of work, and it is not always possible to request them without fail. In addition, cyber attacks on ICS (Industrial Control System) have been increasing recently, especially in 2020, when there were many cases of ransomware infections that caused damage to ICS. Furthermore, the number of reports of ICS vulnerabilities is increasing every year. In response to this situation, penetration testing for ICS has been attracting much attention.

In this work, we developed Mushikago, an automatic penetration testing tool using game AI, which focuses on the verification of post-exploit among penetration tools. A post-exploit is an attack that an attacker carries out after entering the target environment. By focusing on post-exploit verification, we can understand how far an attacker can actually penetrate and what kind of information is collected. Mushikago uses the GOAP (Goal Oriented Action Planning), which is game AI commonly used in NPC (Non Player Character). To using Mushikago, we can flexibly change the content of the attack according to the environment and mimic the attacks conducted by actual APT attackers and testers. It is also possible to identify terminal information, account information, and network information without manual intervention, and visualize and report them based on MITRE ATT&CK. In addition, Mushikago supports ICS, and can be used for penetration testing across IT and OT (Operation Technology).

![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Red--Teaming](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Red--Teaming-gray)  
Generally, when deploying applications that use Machine Learning or Deep Learning algorithms, only security audits check for common vulnerabilities. However, these algorithms are also exposed to other vulnerabilities or weaknesses that attackers could exploit. A framework, called OMLASP - Open Machine Learning Application Security Project, is being developed to gather a list of attack and mitigation techniques for these algorithms. This Framework aims to become a standard for auditing Machine Learning algorithms and has been divided into the following two sections:

• Security: the attack surface and attack scenarios will be defined and the capabilities and goals of the attackers. The different attack and defense techniques will be described in-depth to define a methodology to perform an audit of these algorithms.

• Biases: the reasons, types, and solutions will be explained in detail to define a methodology to minimize them. This part is still under development.

![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Red--Teaming](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Red--Teaming-gray)  
Octopus is an open source, pre-operation C2 server based on python which can control an Octopus powershell agent through HTTP/S.

The main purpose of creating Octopus is for use before any red team operation, where rather than starting the engagement with your full operational arsenal and infrastructure, you can use Octopus first to attack the target and gather information before you start your actual red team operation.

Octopus works in a very simple way to execute commands and exchange information with the C2 over a well encrypted channel, which makes it inconspicuous and undetectable from almost every AV, endpoint protection, and network monitoring solution.

One cool feature in Octopus is called ESA, which stands for "Endpoint Situational Awareness", which will gather some important information about the target that will help you to gain better understanding of the target network endpoints that you will face during your operation, thus giving you a shot to customize your real operation arsenal based on this information.

Octopus is designed to be stealthy and covert while communicating with the C2, as it uses AES-256 by default for its encrypted channel between the powershell agent and the C2 server. You can also opt for using SSL/TLS by providing a valid certficate for your domain and configuring the Octopus C2 server to use it.

![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Red--Teaming](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Red--Teaming-gray)  
Over the past two decades, research has been conducted on using AI to detect malware by extracting features and then classifying them using machine learning algorithms.

What's more interesting is how adversaries have begun using AI to attack these AI models. One current use case of such an approach is the use of AI (GAN) to generate Deepfakes.

Pesidious draws inspiration from this approach to use AI to mutate the malware samples in order to evade AI-based classifiers.
The tool uses the Generative Adversarial Network to first generate benign-looking imports and sections that can make malware look benign and fool machine learning models. We further use deep reinforcement learning to teach a model in which other mutations can reduce the detection rate for malware. The various mutations include changes to imports, exports, headers, signature, sections, and size.

Pesidious bagged the first place prize and a whopping $40000 in the HITB CyberWeek AI challenge 2019, and we are back again with some additional features to improve its efficiency and the chaos it brings with it!

### [Power Automate C2: Stealth Living-Off-the-Cloud C2 Framework](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Red--Teaming](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Red--Teaming-gray)  
PowerAutomate C2 is a framework designed to emulate "Living Off the Cloud" attacks, leveraging only legitimate functions in PowerAutomate.

The battlefield has shifted from the endpoint to the cloud in evolving cyber warfare. This shift can increase the wealth of useful information the cloud offers, making it a more lucrative target for attackers. This transition introduces a new tactic, "Living Off the Cloud," which has become increasingly prevalent in cyber-attacks.

PowerAutomate, a powerful cloud-based automation platform also known as the "New PowerShell", allows for the execution of these "Living Off the Cloud" attacks. PowerAutomate is particularly attractive to attackers as it enables stealth activities. One characteristic is a client-free execution which carries out an attack that leaves no logs on the client and completes entirely in the cloud. It ensures no traces are left on the endpoint, network devices, or within the Office 365 environment. Despite this, continuous access to PowerAutomate on the victim's user profile is required to execute and manage the flow of an attack. PowerAutomate provides a connector known as PowerAutomate Management to address this challenge. This connector allows for managing the flow itself, thus eliminating the need for persistent access to the victim's user profile.

In this presentation, we introduce the concept and demonstration of PowerAutomate C2, which utilizes the basic functions of PowerAutomate and exclusively employs the PowerAutomate Management connector. PowerAutomate C2 is built on a Python-based platform, enabling control over PowerAutomate's flow without a GUI-based low-code interface. This approach also facilitates the remote creation and deletion of flows with no logs, even after access to PowerAutomate is lost. For C2 communication, we have implemented support for HTTP(S) and storage services like Dropbox, enhancing the flexibility and stealth of the operation. We also alert the risk of improper permission to use PowerAutomate Management.


### [PowerGuest: AAD Guest Exploitation Beyond Enumeration](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Red--Teaming](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Red--Teaming-gray)  
Azure AD guest accounts are widely used to grant external parties limited access to enterprise resources, with the assumption that these accounts pose little security risk. As you're about to see, this assumption is dangerously wrong.

PowerGuest is a new tool that allows you to achieve the full potential of a guest in Azure AD by exploiting a series of undocumented internal APIs and common misconfiguration for collecting privileges, and using those for data exfiltration and actions on target, leaving no traces behind. The tool operates by leveraging shared credentials shared over Power Platform, a low-code / no-code platform built into Office365.

PowerGuest allows gaining unauthorized access to sensitive business data and capabilities including corporate SQL servers, SharePoint sites, and KeyVault secrets. Furthermore, it allows guests to create and control internal business applications to move laterally within the organization. All capabilities are fully operational with the default Office 365 and Azure AD configuration.


### [PowerShell-RAT](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Red--Teaming](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Red--Teaming-gray)  
PowerShell-RAT is a stealthy tool which exfiltrates sensitive information from the Windows environment through screenshots and keystrokes. The exfiltrated information is sent to a malicious user over a HTTPS protocol in the form of email attachments. The RAT can be invoked with a single key press using 'Hail Mary' option. Gmail is used to receive files from the backdoored machine. As Gmail is considered one of the highly trusted domains, this would allow an attacker to avoid network detection by NextGen Firewalls.

During a Red Team engagement, this tool can be executed on any Windows machine which backdoors the user machine using a number of task schedulers which will run the PowerShell scripts. Once backdoored, malicious user receives screenshots of the user activities via email every 5 minutes. After the email is received, screenshots are deleted from the machine to clean up the disk space, hence, avoiding the detection.

On successful authentication on a Windows machine, backdoor triggers the keystroke module on the user machine. It saves every key press via keyboard in the "log.txt" file on the user machine and sends it to the malicious user every hour as an email attachment. Setup requires a dedicated throw away Gmail account with modification to PowerShell script credential variables and a malicious user needs to enable "Allow less secure apps" under the security settings of the Gmail account to receive screenshots and key logs from the backdoored machine.

Target system can be identified using attachments naming convention which is Computer name followed by the timestamp. The backdoor Python file can be converted into an executable using Pyinstaller. During demo, I would also walk through a number of defence mechanisms to detect stealthy backdoors using publicly available tools such as Sysinternals from Microsoft.


### [Powerglot: Encoding offensive scripts using polyglots for stego-malware, privilege escalation & lateral movement](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Red--Teaming](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Red--Teaming-gray)  
In red-team exercises or offensive tasks, masking of payloads is usually done by using steganography, especially to avoid network level protections, being one of the most common payloads scripts developed in powershell. Recent malware and APTs make use of some of these capabilities: APT32, APT37, Ursnif, Powload, LightNeuron/Turla, Platinum APT, Waterbug/Turla, Lokibot, The dukes (operation Ghost), Titanium, etc. But offensive tools based on steganography need a loader to run the payload. Powerglot tries to reduce this exposition using polyglots in several scenarios.

Powerglot is a multifunctional and multi-platform attack and defense tool based on polyglots. Powerglot allows to mask a script (powershell, shellscripting, php, ...) mainly in a digital image, although other file formats are in progress. Unlike the usual offensive tools or malware, Powerglot does not need any loader to execute the "information hidden", minimizing the noise on the target system.

PowerGlot has a clear utility in offensive tasks but it is also defined as a discovery and blue team tool. To our knowledge, it is the first general and complete open-source tool that allows to search for the presence of masked information with polyglots, information that could be useful to achieve persistence in a system or to hide malware (stego-malware, privilege escalation, lateral movement, reverse shell, etc.)


### [Puppet Fuzz: Discovering Critical Kernel Vulnerabilities with Innovative Approach](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Red--Teaming](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Red--Teaming-gray)  
Internet of Things (IoT) devices have become an integral part of our lives, but their security vulnerabilities pose a significant risk to our privacy and security. While previous research has focused on user space components of embedded firmware, we have discovered that kernel vulnerabilities in these complex devices are particularly high-risk, potentially leading to full system compromise.
Kernel modules are typically tightly bound to the kernel, but because different IoT devices use different kernel versions and compile options, it is difficult to load them correctly in other simulated environments. However, true device-based fuzz testing is very time-consuming and resource-intensive. Additionally, unlike user-level programs, kernel-level programs require a device reboot after every crash, which further limits the development of IoT kernel fuzz testing.
To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that abstracts closed-source kernel modules code to execute on a stable Linux kernel environment that we have constructed by using our aspect oriented system. This platform allows us to transfer library function calls and stack management, enabling us to detect kernel-level vulnerabilities that were previously difficult to identify. In addition, due to our front-end and back-end separation design, the platform can easily support IoT drivers of multiple architectures. Our approach has enabled us to discover a multitude of issues across devices from top manufacturers such as Netgear, Cisco, Asus, HP,TPLink,DLink and Western Digital etc.
In this talk, we will show our method and present one such universal kernel hardware module vulnerability, demonstrating how we were able to exploit a kernel driver vulnerability to achieve remote command execution on the device. Our platform provides a replicable and stable environment that forms the basis for efficient and effective kernel fuzz testing, ultimately improving the security of IoT devices and protecting the privacy of their users.

### [PyRDP: Python 3 Remote Desktop Protocol Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) and Library](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Red--Teaming](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Red--Teaming-gray)  
PyRDP is an RDP man-in-the-middle tool that has applications in pentesting and malware research. On the pentesting side, PyRDP has a number of features that allow attackers to compromise RDP sessions when combined with TCP man-in-the-middle solutions. If network-level authentication (NLA) is not enforced on an organization's RDP servers, attackers can use PyRDP to take complete control of RDP sessions. The graphical interface shows the client's credentials, keystrokes and clipboard contents as well as the current screen. It also has a "take control" button that allows attackers to hijack sessions. While the attacker is in control, all output going to the client is blocked to hide malicious activity. PyRDP also lists the contents of the drives mapped by the clients and allows attackers to download files from them. Finally, attackers can configure the man-in-the-middle to automatically run payloads on new connections. These payloads can be console commands or PowerShell scripts, and are hidden from the clients. Attackers can make use of PyRDP even when NLA is enforced by redirecting traffic to their own virtual machine. This setup allows them to collect credentials and use the functionalities for stealing clipboard contents and files.

On the malware research side, PyRDP can be used as part of a fully interactive honeypot. It can be placed in front of a Windows RDP server to intercept malicious sessions. It has the ability to replace the credentials provided in the connection sequence with working credentials to accelerate compromise and malicious behavior collection. It also saves a visual and textual recording of each RDP session, which is useful for investigation. Additionally, PyRDP saves a copy of the files that are transferred via the drive redirection feature, allowing it to collect malicious payloads. This accelerates malware analysis since there is no need to search for the payloads on the infected machines or in the network activity.

![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Red--Teaming](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Red--Teaming-gray)  
PyRDP is a Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) monster-in-the-middle (MITM) tool and library useful in intrusion testing, and protocol and malware research. Its out-of-the-box offensive capabilities can be divided in three broad categories: client-side, MITM-side and server-side. On the client-side, PyRDP can actively steal any clipboard activity, crawl mapped drives and collect all keystrokes. On the MITM-side PyRDP records everything on the wire in several formats (logs, JSON events), captures the user's hashes on-the-fly to enable hash cracking, it also allows an attacker to take control of an active session and performs a pixel perfect recording of the RDP screen. On the server-side, on-logon PowerShell or command injection can be performed when a legitimate client connects.

As a research tool, PyRDP can be used as part of a fully interactive honeypot. It can be placed in front of a Windows RDP server to intercept malicious sessions. It can replace the credentials provided in the connection sequence with working credentials to accelerate compromise and malicious behavior collection. It also saves a visual and textual recording of each RDP session, which is useful for investigation or to generate IOCs. Additionally, PyRDP saves a copy of the files that are transferred via the drive redirection feature, allowing it to collect malicious payloads.

This year we have implemented NetNTLMv2 hash capturing for NLA sessions which enables pentesters and offensive researchers to crack hashes in order to retrieve passwords used during the user's connection.

### [RATTLER](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Red--Teaming](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Red--Teaming-gray)  
Rattler is a tool that automates the identification of DLL's which can be used for DLL preloading attacks on Windows 7/8.1/10. The automation of such a process significantly decreases the amount of time required to identify vulnerable and exploitable DLL's.

For example, if an application were to have ~100 DLL's and if it took ~2 minutes to test each DLL, that is ~2 hours for a single application to be tested using a manual process. Additionally, the process for testing an application for DLL preloading vulnerabilities is rather simple and can be automated trivially using some C++, Windows API calls and fresh beard oil , hence Rattler.

The identification of vulnerable DLL's can assist in an attacker in achieving code execution or escalation of privileges.


### [RID Hijacking: Maintaining Access on Windows Machines](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Red--Teaming](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Red--Teaming-gray)  
The art of persistence is (and will be...) a matter of concern when successfully exploitation is achieved. Sometimes it is pretty tricky to maintain access on certain environments, especially when it is not possible to execute common vectors like creating or adding users to privileged groups, dumping credentials or hashes, deploying a persistent shell, or anything that could trigger an alert on the victim. This statement ratifies why it's necessary to use discrete and stealthy techniques to keep an open door right after obtaining a high privilege access on the target.

What could be more convenient that only use OS resources in order to persist an access? This presentation will provide a new post-exploitation hook applicable to all Windows versions called RID Hijacking, which allows setting desired privileges to an existent account in a stealthy manner by modifying some security attributes. To show its effectiveness, the attack will be demonstrated by using a module which was recently added by Rapid7 to their Metasploit Framework, and developed by the security researcher Sebastián Castro.

### [RedHerd Framework](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Red--Teaming](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Red--Teaming-gray)  
RedHerd is a collaborative serverless framework for orchestrating a geographically distributed set of assets in order to simulate/conduct complex offensive cyberspace operations. The design and implementation of RedHerd perfectly fit the Open Systems Architecture design pattern, thanks to the adoption of both open standards and wide-spread open source software components.

The framework allows to seamlessly deploy a ready-to-use infrastructure that can be adopted for effective conduct, simulation and training purposes, by reliably joining a real-world cyberspace battlefield in which red and blue teams challenge each other to reach their goals. These elements lead to the Offensive Cyberspace Operations as a Service (OCOaaS) paradigm, which involves a complete software solution, locally set up, remotely deployed or Cloud-based, offering a layer of abstraction placed in front of the operative infrastructure and tools.

In this way, the operational actors have the opportunity to focus on the task execution, while ignoring all of the collateral activities. In addition, OCOaaS provides a flexible and quickly deployable solution to reduce costs. The RedHerd framework is a practical implementation of this model empowering the approach with strong orchestration capabilities and other additional features.


### [Remove-Signature](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Red--Teaming](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Red--Teaming-gray)  
Remove-Signature is a tool designed to automate the process of generating a payload that can bypass anti-virus detection.

During red team testing, red team operators often need to prepare a payload that will not be detected by anti-virus software in order to be successful. One way to do this is to identify where the signatures used by anti-virus software are located in the payload, and then modifies bytes of the locations so that the modified payload will not be detected as malicious. This process can be time-consuming.

Remove-Signature aims to automate this process by identifying the signatures in the payload, and modifying a single byte of the signatures location in a way that will bypass anti-virus detection, while still maintaining the functionality of the payload. The tool understands the PE file format and only makes modifications that will not affect the payload's functionality. Unlike other existing tools that can only identify signatures, Remove-Signature is able to automatically generate a modified payload that can evade anti-virus detection.

The use of Remove-Signature can help to reduce the workload of red team operators and allow them to focus on other aspects of the red team engagement.

### [SCMKit: Source Code Management Attack Toolkit](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Red--Teaming](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Red--Teaming-gray)  
Source Code Management (SCM) systems play a vital role within organizations and have been an afterthought in terms of defenses compared to other critical enterprise systems such as Active Directory. SCM systems are used in the majority of organizations to manage source code and integrate with other systems within the enterprise as part of the DevOps pipeline, such as CI/CD systems like Jenkins. These SCM systems provide attackers with opportunities for software supply chain attacks and can facilitate lateral movement and privilege escalation throughout an organization.

This presentation will announce the public release of SCMKit, a toolkit that can be used to attack SCM systems. SCMKit allows the user to specify the SCM system and attack module to use, along with specifying valid credentials (username/password or API key) to the respective SCM system. Currently, the SCM systems that SCMKit supports are GitHub Enterprise, GitLab Enterprise and Bitbucket Server. The attack modules supported include reconnaissance, privilege escalation and persistence. SCMKit was built in a modular approach, so that new modules and SCM systems can be added in the future by the information security community.


### [SETH](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Red--Teaming](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Red--Teaming-gray)  
Seth is a tool written in Python and Bash to MitM RDP connections. It attempts to downgrade the connection and extract clear text credentials - even with Network Level Authentication enabled.

The default configuration in a Windows landscape is to use self-signed certificates to secure SSL connections to RDP hosts. Since self-signed certificates provide almost no security at all, it is obvious that an attacker in a "Man in the Middle" position can simply present their own certificate and eavesdrop on the connection. However, so far there were no freely available open source tools that can do this. In order to raise awareness of how important it is to use properly signed certificates, Seth was developed.

It performs a man in the middle attack, downgrades any additional security if possible and extracts interesting information, such as password hashes, clear text credentials or key stroke events.


### [SIEMs Framework: Open Source MultiSIEM Python Attack Framework](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Red--Teaming](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Red--Teaming-gray)  
SIEMs are defensive tools increasingly used in information security, especially in large companies and regulated companies to monitor critical networks and devices. However, from the standpoint of the attacker, the permissions that the SIEMs have on the devices and accounts of a corporate network are very broad. Administrative access to a SIEM can be used to obtain code execution in the server where the SIEM is installed, and, in some cases, also in the "client" equipment from which the SIEM collects events, such as Active Directory servers, Databases, and network devices like Firewalls and Routers.

During our investigation, we detected many attack vectors that could be used in different SIEMs to compromise them, such as:

Obtaining the user accounts and passwords of critical equipment stored in the SIEM (LDAP/AD servers, databases, network devices, generally accounts with administrative permissions)
Developing and installing malicious applications such as a bind shell or a reverse shell to compromise the server where the SIEM is installed, or send malicious applications to compromise the devices from which the SIEM collects the events
Performing a brute force attack on the SIEM web interface
Reading arbitrary files from the server where the SIEM is installed
Using log events as intelligence source

Based on the results of this research, we developed an open source tool in Python: SIEMs Framework that allows to automate the mentioned attacks, both in commercial and open source SIEMs.


### [SILENTTRINITY (v0.2.0): Async Post-Exploitation Agent Powered by Python, C# & .NET's DLR](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Red--Teaming](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Red--Teaming-gray)  
SILENTTRINITY is an asynchronous post-exploitation agent powered by Python, IronPython, C# and .NET's DLR (Dynamic Language Runtime), it attempts to weaponize and demonstrate the flexibility that BYOI (Bring Your Own Interpreter) payloads have over traditional C# implants. What are BYOI payloads? Turns out, by harnessing the sheer craziness of the .NET framework, you can embed entire interpreters inside of .NET languages allowing you to natively execute scripts written in third-party languages (like Python) on windows! Not only does this allow you to dynamically access all of the .NET API from a scripting language of your choosing, but it also allows you to still remain completely in memory and has a number of advantages over traditional C# payloads! Essentially, BYOI payloads allow you to have all the "power" of PowerShell, without going through PowerShell in anyway! Additionally, you can nest multiple interpreters within each other to perform what I've coined "engine inception"! If you're interested in bleeding-edge and out of the ordinary C#/.NET offensive trade-craft, this is the demo for you!

It can even be injected as a shared library into a running process to hide its presence. It assumes nothing, and just gives the Red a consistent, reliable and flexible tunnel into the network.


### [Scanhanced: An Automation Tool for Pentesting and Vulnerability Assessments](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Red--Teaming](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Red--Teaming-gray)  
A lot of the initial steps in black box penetration testing involve information gathering using techniques such as port scanning. This information is then usually used for OSINT such as searching for known vulnerabilities for the found services and versions. Next steps often include searching for exploits for the found vulnerabilities. This process is inconvenient as it is often both labor and time intensive, both of which can often be a limiting factor for an engagement.
Scanhanced solves this by providing an easy command line interface that can then perform the previously mentioned steps automatically, reducing both labor and time needed to minutes. It will perform a port scan, and then using that information attempt to find vulnerabilities and search community resources for exploits. Additionally, Scanhanced provides additional features such as identifying whether a given exploit is available in existing exploit frameworks, being able to download exploits, or download the vulnerable apps in question. Moreover, Scanhanced can produce output in JSON, XML, or CSV for use in further automation or ingestion into another tool if so desired.
This entire process in addition to more complex functionality can be performed with an easy to use command and flags, saving pentesters time and from having to do tedious work.


### [Secureworks® Primary Refresh Token (PRT) viewer](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Red--Teaming](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Red--Teaming-gray)  
Azure AD registered and joined devices use a device certificate and transport key to sign and decrypt communication between the device and Azure AD. The most important part of this is Primary Refresh Token (PRT) and an associated session key. The session key can be decrypted with the transport key and subsequent communication with the session key.
Secureworks® Primary Refresh Token (PRT) viewer automates the decryption process. Using the transport key exported from the target computer, it automatically decrypts the session key from the PRT authentication request response. With the decrypted session key, it decrypts subsequent requests/responses decrypted with the session key.
The tool enables monitoring the traffic between the target device and Azure AD in plaintext, allowing extracting keys, access tokens, and other secrets.
The tool is available as Burp Suite Extender and Fiddler Add-On.

SharpSCCM 2.0 - Abusing Microsoft's C2 Framework

SharpSCCM is a post-exploitation tool designed to leverage Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager (a.k.a. ConfigMgr, formerly SCCM) for credential gathering and lateral movement without requiring access to the SCCM administration console GUI (e.g., from a C2 agent).

The release of SharpSCCM 2.0 includes new functionality to execute arbitrary commands on groups of devices, coerce NTLM authentication from remote SCCM clients that belong to specific users, dump and decrypt additional credentials from an SCCM client or by requesting them from a management point, and triage of local client files for software distribution point locations.

This session will include demonstrations of multiple techniques that can be used to take over an SCCM site, dump credentials from an SCCM client, execute arbitrary commands on remote SCCM clients, and coerce NTLM authentication from remote SCCM clients and servers.

Each demo will be followed by practical recommendations for mitigating these attacks and Q&A.


### [SharpToken: Windows Token Stealing Expert](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Red--Teaming](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Red--Teaming-gray)  
During red team lateral movement, we often need to steal the permissions of other users. Under the defense of modern EDR, it is difficult for us to use Mimikatz to obtain other user permissions, and if the target user has no process alive, we have no way to use "OpenProcessToken" to steal Token.


SharpToken is a tool for exploiting Token leaks. It can find leaked Tokens from all processes in the system and use them. If you are a low-privileged service user, you can even use it to upgrade to "NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM" privileges, and you can switch to the target user's desktop to do more without the target user's password. ..

![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Red--Teaming](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Red--Teaming-gray)  
From past to present, signature-based detection has been one of the first and most basic methods used to detect malicious files. Even today, every file written to the file system is first scanned using the signatures found in the database of security products. Therefore, when creating variants of a tool or a technique, one of the most used methods to prevent them from being captured by a single signature is Polymorphism.

While polymorphism was used for this purpose, it was embedded in the virus variant as an engine, especially in self-propagating viruses. Nowadays, polymorphism occurs in the obfuscation of a binary or a shellcode. New variants of these codes, which are produced with polymorphic encoders such as Shikata Ga Nai (SGN), make them difficult to detect with a general and single YARA rule. Shoggoth is yet another polymorphic encoder written using asmjit library.

For each encoding period of a binary, Shoggoth generates different encryption routines with different garbage instructions. After obtaining the encrypted form of the payload, the tool merges it with its decryptor stub which again contains different garbage instructions. Shoggoth uses asmjit library for assembling the process of randomly generated encryption and garbage instructions.


### [SquarePhish: Combining QR Codes and OAuth 2.0 Device Code Flow for Advanced Phishing Attacks](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Red--Teaming](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Red--Teaming-gray)  
SquarePhish is an advanced phishing tool that uses a technique combining the OAuth Device code authentication flow and QR codes. Previous OAuth 2.0 Device Code phishing tools (like PhishInSuits) required a user open the phishing email and authenticate within 15 minutes of the email being sent. This drastically decreased the chances of a successful phish, as many emails expired prior to user interaction.

SquarePhish fixes this issue, by decoupling the initial email from the OAuth Device Code flow. Combining this technique, QR Codes, and a Microsoft MFA pretext we are able to perform advanced phishing attacks.

We have also added a subtool called Rephresh that utilizes undocumented Microsoft functionality that allows the SquarePhish obtained tokens to be swapped out for tokens for other applications.

The ultimate goal for any security team is to increase resiliency within an organization and adapt to the modern threat. Starkiller aims to provide red teams with a platform to emulate Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) tactics. Starkiller is a frontend for the post-exploitation framework, PowerShell Empire, which incorporates a multi-user GUI application that interfaces with a remote Command and Control (C2) server. Empire is powered by Python 3 and PowerShell and includes many widely used offensive security tools for Windows, Linux, and macOS exploitation. The framework's flexibility to easily incorporate new modules allows for a single solution for red team operations.

![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Red--Teaming](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Red--Teaming-gray)  
Stratus Red Team is an open-source project for adversary emulation and validation of threat detection in the cloud. It comes with a catalog of cloud-native attack techniques mapped to MITRE ATT&CK that you can easily detonate against a live cloud environment or Kubernetes cluster.

Stratus Red Team supports common AWS and Kubernetes attack techniques. You can point it at a live AWS account or Kubernetes cluster and easily detonate TTPs commonly used by offensive actors, without any prerequisite infrastructure or configuration needed. It helps you validate your threat detection end-to-end and even has a programmatic interface to integrate it with existing automation.
Stratus Red Team transparently leverages Terraform to provision the infrastructure required to detonate TTPs, and Go to perform the actual attacks. The TTPs it packages are opinionated: granular, threat-informed, and actionable for defenders.


### [Suborner: A Windows Bribery for Invisible Persistence](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Red--Teaming](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Red--Teaming-gray)  
Whenever an attacker is trying to persist the access on a compromised machine, the first offensive approach usually involves the creation of a new identity. Nevertheless, this may not work easily under hardened environments with diverse detection mechanisms against common attack vectors.

What if we "suborn" Windows to create our own hidden account that will grant us total access to a victim, while stealthily impersonating any account we want?

Now it is possible with the Suborner Attack.

This technique will dynamically create an invisible machine account with custom credentials and custom properties without calling any user management Win32 APIs (e.g. netapi32.dll::netuseradd) and therefore evading detection mechanisms (e.g Event IDs 4720, 4721). By "suborning" Windows, we can also impersonate any desired account to keep our stealthiness even after a successful authentication/authorization.

To show its effectiveness, the attack is going to be demonstrated against the latest Windows version available.


### [The Metasploit Framework's Payload Improvements](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Red--Teaming](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Red--Teaming-gray)  
Memory corruption vulnerabilities are becoming less common than their more reliable command execution counterparts. In the last year, two-thirds of the exploits Metasploit released resulted in OS command execution in some way as opposed to direct execution of injected code. Metasploit has made multiple improvements to its command payloads to keep pace with these exploitation trends. These updates make it easier for module authors to deliver a wider variety of second-stage payloads and grant users greater flexibility in selecting their delivery mechanism.

This arsenal demonstration will cover the latest improvements to Metasploits payloads, command stagers, and Meterpreter. The audience will see how these payloads can be used, customized and how the exploit development process has improved.


### [The Metasploit Framework](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Red--Teaming](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Red--Teaming-gray)  
Modern attack emulation is a multi-step process involving different tools and techniques as testers execute custom workflows to achieve their objectives. One primary advantage of the Metasploit Framework is a unified approach to solving this problem.

This arsenal demonstration will cover some of the latest improvements to the Metasploit Framework and showcase how these improvements maximize effectiveness while performing common tasks. Viewers will see the latest workflows for capturing credentials, UI optimizations for running modules, and demonstrations of Metasploit's new payload-less session types. Capturing credentials is an integral part of many penetration testing methodologies and, when combined with the Metasploit database, can be a powerful technique for users engaged in breaching simulations. The latest features streamline configuring all the services Metasploit has capture modules for and managing them as a single unit. Users will also learn about some of the latest improvements related to pivoting in Metasploit, which allow capturing services to be started on compromised hosts when combined.


### [ThunderCloud: Attack Cloud Without Keys!](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Red--Teaming](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Red--Teaming-gray)  
"You can't audit a cloud environment without access keys!!".

Well. That's not completely true.

There is a good number of tools that help security teams find cloud misconfiguration issues. They work inside-out way where you give read-only access tokens to the tool and the tool gives you misconfigurations.

There's no single tool that helps Red Teamers and Bug Hunters find cloud misconfiguration issues the outside-in way.

This outside-in approach can find issues like:

1. S3 directory listing due to misconfigured Cloudfront settings
2. Amazon Cognito misconfiguration to generate AWS temporary credentials
3. Public snapshots
4. Generate Account takeover Phishing links for AWS SSO
5. Leaked Keys permission enumeration
6. IAM role privilege escalation
a) From leaked keys
b) Lambda Function

This exploitation framework also helps teams within organizations to do red teaming activities or run it across the accounts to learn more about misconfigurations from AWS and how badly they can be exploited.

ThunderCloud version 2 will now support GCP and Azure exploitation. Additionally will be releasing an open source "CLOUD OFFENSIVE" gitbook along with the same

![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Red--Teaming](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Red--Teaming-gray)  
One of the main premises of any IT installation, is to protect the entire infrastructure against possible failures. In addition to firewalls and other network elements, one of the vital points is the electrical system.

Thanks to uninterruptible power supplies (UPS), it is possible to cover and manage these issues economically. The main problem, is that many of these systems inherit the same bugs as other IoT devices, which makes them vulnerable to all kinds of attacks.

In this presentation, we will explain how it has been possible to develop different zero-day vulnerabilities thanks to social engineering, some investment, and a bit of common sense. Among other things, these flaws would make it possible to compromise the electrical system of an office or even that of a Data Center.

Since these devices share common components, it would be possible to obtain remote code execution (with the highest possible privileges) and/or denial of service on more than 100 different manufacturers. Moreover, all of this has been automated in a single framework, making it possible to detect and exploit these vulnerabilities easily, simply and fully automatically.


### [Tool Aids in Monitoring Dynamic Scanning](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Red--Teaming](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Red--Teaming-gray)  
Antivirus software, as one of the important tools to protect computer security, its detection technology is also constantly developing. At the same time, penetration testing and malicious attacks have become more difficult. The core principle of our newly developed network security tool is to load the security software to be used into memory and relocate all import function tables (IAT) to a middle code area, so that it can continue to run without being killed. When each external function is referenced, it will jump to the middle stub function and retain the call information. If our security tool is killed by antivirus software, we can easily find the detection point of antivirus software based on the call information. Our security tool can detect its scanning rules in real time while antivirus software is running, so as to help you understand the behavior and rules of antivirus software. Our tool can detect antivirus software without disrupting its normal work, so as to help you better understand the behavior and rules of antivirus software.

Git Wild Hunt is a tool that allows researchers and security operators to find leaked credentials and secrets in Github covering over 30 types of credentials. This tool is great for cloud security/DevOps security awareness or for cloud security pentesters and red teamers. We will show how deep into an organization or even personal sensitive information can be found by simply starting from leaked credentials in a GitHub project.


### [go-exploit: An Exploit Framework for Go](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Red--Teaming](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Red--Teaming-gray)  
go-exploit is an exploit development framework for Go. The framework helps exploit developers create small, self-contained, portable, and consistent exploits.

Many proof-of-concept exploits rely on interpreted languages with complicated packaging systems. They implement wildly differing user interfaces, and have limited ability to be executed within a target network. Some exploits are integrated into massive frameworks that are burdened by years of features and dependencies which overwhelm developers and hinder the attacker's ability to deploy the exploits from unconventional locations.

To overcome these challenges, go-exploit offers a lightweight framework with minimal dependencies, written in Go—a language renowned for its portability and cross-compilation capabilities. The framework strikes a balance between simplicity for rapid proof-of-concept development and the inclusion of sophisticated built-in features for operational use.


### [hideNsneak: An Attack Obfuscation Framework](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Red--Teaming](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Red--Teaming-gray)  
hideNsneak evolved as a tool to expand evasive penetration testing capabilities. It allows users to rapidly deploy, manage, and quickly take down a distributed cloud attack infrastructure by leveraging features of large Cloud Providers and their content delivery networks. Techniques include domain fronting with multiple providers, distributed scanning, and source of attack obfuscation. Leaning on the reputation of these networks allows traffic to more easily blend in to network traffic and create difficulty in blocking attack infrastructure. Furthermore, the ephemeral nature of the tool itself provides a realistic threat simulation, which also simulates the realistic headache this type of attack causes defenders, when they try to attribute actions to certain sets of hosts.

The overview of the toolsets features will contain an explanation of the tactics and techniques in order to provide both red teamers and blue teamers alike with more insight into why this works in "modern" networks, as well as real world scenarios. Also, this tool was written in the Go programming standard in which each functionality is encapsulated in its own package. This allows for users to use the frameworks individual packages in their own projects as well as add components with relative ease. Finally, information will be provided to blue teamers in an effort to provide knowledge that can be brought back and leveraged to increase security posture.


### [iBombShell: Dynamic Remote Shell](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Red--Teaming](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Red--Teaming-gray)  
The emergence of PowerShell within pentesting post-exploitation is important. Its flexibility, possibilities and power make this Microsoft´s command line an efficient post-exploitation tool. In scenarios where we cannot use neither install pentesting techniques this tool acquires special relevance. iBombShell gives access to a pentesting repository where the pentester could use any function oriented to the post-exploitation phase and, in some cases, exploit vulnerabilities. iBombShell is a remote pentesting Shell that loads itself automatically in memory offering unlimited tools for the pentester.

iBombShell is a tool written in PowerShell that allows post-exploitation functionalities in a shell or a prompt, anytime and in any operating system. Moreover, it allows, in some cases, the execution of vulnerability exploitation features. These features are loaded dynamically, depending on when they are needed, from a GitHub repository.

The shell is downloaded directly to memory giving access to many pentesting features and functionalities, avoiding any hard drive access. These functionalities downloaded to memory are in PowerShell function format. This execution strategy is called EveryWhere.

In addition, iBombShell allows a second way of execution called Silently. Using this execution way, an iBombShell instance (called warrior) can be launched. When the Warrior is executed over a compromised machine, it will connect to a C2 through the http protocol. From the C2, written in Python, a warrior can be controlled to dynamically load functions to the memory and to offer pentesting remote execution functionalities. All those steps are part of the post-exploitation phase.


### [pstf^2: Link Scanners Evasion Made Easy](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Red--Teaming](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Red--Teaming-gray)  
Link scanners are a critical component in many essential security products, checking whether a URL is malicious or not. It is embedded within email security products, sandbox solutions and as a standalone direct link scanner.

This tool will present how to circumvent them all using passive browser fingerprinting - a set of techniques allowing a server to profile a client based only on the request being sent.

While often used to detect and repel internet bots, we will show how this fingerprinting can be applied against blue teamers, specifically - how a resourceful attacker may use it to determine if it is being scanned and serve benign content to scanners while delivering harmful content to users.

pstf^2 leverages passive fingerprints in HTTP, TCP, IP layers and even link-layer protocols.

![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Red--Teaming](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Red--Teaming-gray)  
tty2web can take any console program and convert it into a web application. It provides a proper console for your shell needs directly inside your browser, which means programs like vim, mc, or any program that needs tty will work as expected by default. Features include support for both bind and reverse mode, which is useful for penetration testing and NAT traversal, bidirectional file transfer, reverse SOCKS 5 functionality by emulating the regeorg interface, and API support for executing commands (imagine having a RESTful interface to your operating system shell). It supports collaboration and sharing between teams, is multiplatform, and runs well on Unix/Linux-based OSs running container payloads. It is based on gotty but has been heavily improved for security and penetration tester needs.

### [ADRecon: Active Directory Recon](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Network--&--Recon](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Network--&--Recon-gray)  
ADRecon is a tool which extracts various artifacts (as highlighted below) out of an AD environment in a specially formatted Microsoft Excel report that includes summary views with metrics to facilitate analysis. The report can provide a holistic picture of the current state of the target AD environment. The tool is useful to various classes of security professionals like system administrators, security professionals, DFIR, etc. It can also be an invaluable post-exploitation tool for a penetration tester. It can be run from any workstation that is connected to the environment, even hosts that are not domain members. Furthermore, the tool can be executed in the context of a non-privileged (i.e. standard domain user) accounts. Fine Grained Password Policy, LAPS and BitLocker may require Privileged user accounts. The tool will use Microsoft Remote Server Administration Tools (RSAT) if available, otherwise it will communicate with the Domain Controller using LDAP.

The following information is gathered by the tool: Forest; Domain; Trusts; Sites; Subnets; Default Password Policy; Fine Grained Password Policy (if implemented); Domain Controllers, SMB versions, whether SMB Signing is supported and FSMO roles; Users and their attributes; Service Principal Names (SPNs); Groups and memberships; Organizational Units (OUs); ACLs for the Domain, OUs, Root Containers and GroupPolicy objects; Group Policy Object details; DNS Zones and Records; Printers; Computers and their attributes; LAPS passwords (if implemented); BitLocker Recovery Keys (if implemented); and GPOReport (requires RSAT).

### [Afterimage: Evading Traditional IOC Blocking](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Network--&--Recon](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Network--&--Recon-gray)  
Malicious IP addresses are critical indicators of cyber threats, and blocking these addresses is a standard practice during network forensics and incident response. Current solutions for maintaining anonymity, such as Tor nodes and botnets, have proven to be either compromised or illegal, thus posing challenges for legitimate red team exercises. In response to this growing demand for an effective solution, we have developed Afterimage, a novel application that enables attackers to enumerate and attack from multiple IP addresses without requiring the infrastructure of a botnet and with minimal time and effort.

Afterimage operates as an intermediary, accepting malicious traffic from an attacker through an open port, forwarding it to a proxy, and ultimately to the victim. If the proxy's IP is blocked, the application automatically cycles to another proxy to continue sending traffic. This process is more efficient and secure than existing methods such as VPNs, which are often monitored and costly, or compromised solutions like Tor nodes and botnets.

Our proposed solution, written in Python, is designed for deployment on remote servers, enabling multiple attackers to connect simultaneously. This unique approach to IP address cycling addresses key challenges faced during red team exercises, providing a more secure and effective solution for cyber security testing. By leveraging Afterimage, blue teams and SOCs can enhance their incident response capabilities and improve their overall cyber defense strategies.

Armory is a tool designed to run various existing tools, collating all of the output into a local database, and using that information for further attacks. It is extremely modular, and it is pretty easy to create custom modules and reports. Armory's purpose is to streamline client discovery and external penetration tests.


### [BLOODHOUND 1.3 - ARSENAL THEATER DEMO](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Network--&--Recon](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Network--&--Recon-gray)  
Released on-stage at DEF CON 24 last year, BloodHound fundamentally changed the way penetration testers and red teamers approach escalating rights in Active Directory domains. By combining the concepts of derivative local admin and graph theory, coupled with a powerful data ingestion and front-end analysis capability, BloodHound simplified the tedious, repetitive task of escalating rights, saving days, weeks, and sometimes months of manual processing.

In 2017, the BloodHound attack graph schema, data ingestor, and front-end were overhauled to provide greater speed, easier analysis, and brand new attack paths never discovered before. By adding object control edges to the attack graph, a brand new attack landscape was unveiled, allowing attackers and defenders to identify attacks which rely solely on Active Directory object manipulation. These attack paths require no malware, no pivoting, and can always be executed as long as the attacker can communicate with at least one domain controller. From the defender's perspective, identifying and measuring such attack paths was nigh impossible. Now, defenders can also quickly identify and remediate those same attack paths before an attacker can find and exploit them.


### [Badrats: Initial Access Made Easy](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Network--&--Recon](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Network--&--Recon-gray)  
Remote Access Trojans (RATs) are one of the defining tradecraft for identifying an Advanced Persistent Threat. The reason being is that APTs typically leverage custom toolkits for gaining initial access, so they do not risk burning full-featured implants. Badrats takes characteristics from APT Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) and implements them into a custom Command and Control (C2) tool with a focus on initial access and implant flexibility. The key goal is to emulate that modern threat actors avoid loading fully-featured implants unless required, instead opting to use a smaller staged implant.

Badrats implants are written in various languages, each with a similar yet limited feature set. The implants are designed to be small for antivirus evasion and provides multiple methods of loading additional tools, such as shellcode, .NET assemblies, PowerShell, and shell commands on a compromised host. One of the most advanced TTPs that Badrats supports is peer-to-peer communications over SMB to allow implants to communicate through other compromised hosts.


### [Batea: Digging for gold in network data](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Network--&--Recon](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Network--&--Recon-gray)  
Batea is a simple tool that showcases how basic machine learning can help security analysts in their day-to-day operations. It is a context-driven network device ranking framework based on the anomaly detection family of machine learning algorithms. The goal of Batea is to allow security teams to automatically filter interesting network devices in large networks using nmap scan reports. We call those Gold Nuggets. Batea outputs the gold nuggets in order of interest for an attacker given the context of the network.

The human challenge is, on the one hand, that a typical enterprise network will host thousands of endpoints, far too many for a few security team members to constantly track and evaluate for their "attractiveness" to a potential intruder. On the other hand, the notion of interest is highly context-sensitive.

Batea works by constructing a numerical representation of all devices from your nmap reports (XML) and then applying the Isolation Forest algorithm to uncover the gold nuggets. It is easily extendable by adding specific "features", or interesting characteristics, to the numerical representation of the network elements.

The features act as elements of intuition, and the unsupervised anomaly detection methods allow the context of the device, along with the total description of the network, to be used as the central building block of the ranking algorithm.

Given that we have taken meaningful elements of intuition all at once, the fact that the Isolation Forest algorithm always takes the whole dataset into consideration ensures that the network context is embedded in the ranking used to predict Gold Nuggets.

Pen testers can train the Batea machine learning model from scratch on new network data, or use a model that has been pre-trained on various networks.


### [Building Our Nemesis: Fighting Data with Data](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Network--&--Recon](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Network--&--Recon-gray)  
The offensive industry is about exploring what's possible. Part of this is observing and taking lessons from other disciplines that have already solved a myriad of related challenges, from proper software engineering practices to using graph theory for offensive problems. But despite various leaps forward over the last several years, the offensive post-exploitation community has yet to fully embrace data analysis and enrichment pipelines beyond basic log aggregation and searching. If offensive tools were structured for automated processing instead of solely human consumption, we could unify post-ex data to exploit the known (and unknown) relationships within the data our offensive tools emit.

Imagine a system that could ingest data from any C2 framework or post-ex tool, and could not just automate common operator tasks like binary analysis for known vulnerabilities and hash extraction and cracking of encrypted documents, but could perform complex offline analysis like host privilege escalation. If we could unify all post-exploitation data from offensive engagements we could improve operator workflows, provide tradecraft assistance, facilitate automation of onerous tasks, and uncover new data-driven research opportunities. A year ago, our team embarked on the development of just such a system, and we are excited to introduce the result of our effort: Nemesis.


### [CALDERA: Automating Adversary Emulation](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Network--&--Recon](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Network--&--Recon-gray)  
Adversary emulation is great, but it can be time consuming – so why not automate it? CALDERA automates the adversary emulation process, allowing users to run fully automated adversary emulation exercises, aligning its operations with MITRE ATT&CK. Blue and red teamers alike can use CALDERA for training, to test analytics and defensive tools, and just generally to stress test their networks and systems.


CALDERA was first released in late 2017 featuring its end-to-end “adversary mode” capability, where operators could use CALDERA to run fully end-to-end tests emulating the full adversary lifecycle. This mode allowed CALDERA to run intelligently and autonomously, leveraging a planning system to dynamically compose operations.


Since this first release, the MITRE team has continued to expand CALDERA’s capabilities, releasing a new “chain mode” in 2019. This new mode allows users much more control over CALDERA, letting them orchestrate and automate atomic unit tests as opposed to end-to-end operations. With more fine-grained control over CALDERA, users can better control their operations to accommodate more use cases, such as testing and refining analytics.


This demo will highlight both of CALDERA’s modes, providing demos and guides on how to use CALDERA including how to extend it with new plugins and adding additional tests. CALDERA is open source and can be downloaded off of the MITRE GitHub repository.

CrackMapExec (a.k.a CME) is a fully open-source, post-exploitation tool written in Python that helps automate assessing the security of *large* Active Directory networks. Built with stealth in mind, CME follows the concept of "Living off the Land:" abusing built-in Active Directory features/protocols to achieve it's functionality and allowing it to evade endpoint protection/IDS/IPS solutions. CME makes heavy use of the Impacket library and the PowerSploit Toolkit for working with network protocols and performing a variety of post-exploitation techniques. Although meant to be used primarily for offensive purposes (e.g. red teams), CME can be used by blue teams as well to assess account privileges, find possible misconfigurations and simulate attack scenarios. In this demo the author will be showing version 4.0: a major update to the tool bringing more modules, features and capabilities than ever before. If you're interested in the latest & greatest Active Directory attacks, techniques and general cool AD stuff this is the demo for you!


### [DELTA: SDN Security Evaluation Framework](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Network--&--Recon](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Network--&--Recon-gray)  
Software-Defined Networking (SDN) allows network operators to manage the entire network in a centralized manner by separating the vendor specific control plane from legacy routers/switches. Thus, this concept provides an intelligent way to design novel network functions. However, although SDN offers significant advantages over the traditional networking, the security of SDN has not been sufficiently verified. So, here, we introduce an open source tool for systematically assessing the security of SDN called DELTA.

DELTA is a first SDN security evaluation framework, which has two primary functions; (1) It can automatically instantiate known attack cases against SDN elements across diverse environments, and (2) it can assist in uncovering unknown security problems within an SDN deployment. For replaying attack cases, our framework has a number of test cases against open source SDN controllers and all SDN-enabled switch devices (software and hardware). Also, our framework provides a protocol-aware fuzzer for OpenFlow, which is a de-facto standard protocol of SDN, in order to find new vulnerabilities.

DELTA has following main features:

Fully automatically reproduce 40 published exploits against all SDN components composed of SDN controllers, a control channel, and OpenFlow-enabled switches.
Provide a blackbox fuzzing module that randomizes OpenFlow messages.
Support for both VM-based all-in-one single machine and hardware-based environments.
Fully compatible with promising SDN controllers (ONOS, OpenDaylight, Floodlight, and Ryu).
[NEW] Support additional 7 new attacks against SDN switches (i.e., OVS, HP, and Pica8), which are discovered from DELTA fuzzing module.
[NEW] Support DISTRIBUTED controller testing and related attack cases.
[NEW] Provide a new fuzzing module that discovers security problems of REST-API implementations in SDN controllers and related attack cases.

DFEX - [DNS File EXfiltration]

Data exfiltration is a common technique used for post-exploitation, DNS is one of the most common protocols through firewalls.
We take the opportunity to build a unique protocol for transferring files across the network.

Existing tools have some limitations and NG Firewalls are getting a bit "smarter", we have been obliged to explore new combinations of tactics to bypass these. Using the good old fashion "HIPS" (Hidden In Plain Sigh) tricks to push files out.


### [Dolos Cloak: Your NAC Can't See This](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Network--&--Recon](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Network--&--Recon-gray)  
Dolos Cloak is a new tool designed to give penetration testers and red team members the ability to easily bypass 802.1x network access controls. The tool performs an advanced man-in-the-middle attack against nearly any authorized network device, automatically configures a NAT to blend in, and pass legitimate traffic unaltered. Simply plug a Dolos Cloak device in between a network jack and an available workstation, IP phone, printer, or other device and walk away. Dolos Cloak can be configured to call home using TPC/UDP reverse shells, SSH, VPN, Empire, or other custom methods to maintain a stealthy foothold on the network. The creation of Dolos Cloak was inspired by sysadmins that thought they could rely solely on 802.1x to keep attackers off their networks.


### [EAPHAMMER](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Network--&--Recon](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Network--&--Recon-gray)  
EAPHammer is a toolkit for performing targeted evil twin attacks against WPA2-Enterprise networks. It is designed to be used in full scope wireless assessments and red team engagements. As such, focus is placed on providing an easy-to-use interface that can be leveraged to execute powerful wireless attacks with minimal manual configuration.

### [Empire: Post-Exploitation Framework](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Network--&--Recon](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Network--&--Recon-gray)  
Empire is a Command and Control (C2) framework powered by Python 3 that supports Windows, Linux, and macOS exploitation. It leverages many widely used offensive security tools through PowerShell, Python 3, and C# agents. At the same time, it offers cryptologically-secure communications and flexible modular architecture that links Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) through the MITRE ATT&CK database.

Empire has evolved significantly since its introduction in 2015 and has become one of the most widely used open-source C2 platforms. Through this time, Empire has advanced from a single user experience to allowing multiple user operations through an API with Empire acting as a teamserver. Currently, 2 different applications are available to connect to the Empire teamserver: Empire Command Line Interface (CLI) and Starkiller.

The Empire CLI is built from the ground up as a replacement to the embedded legacy CLI and gives users a familiar feel of the legacy CLI, but is portable and connects through the Empire API. While Starkiller is a cross-platform UI available in Linux, Windows, and macOS powered by ElectronJS.

The framework's flexibility to easily incorporate new modules allows for a single solution for red team operations with the aim for Empire to provide an easy-to-use platform for emulating APTs. Customization is essential to any successful red team operation, which has driven the expansion of user plugins. These plugins allow any custom program to run side-by-side with the Empire teamserver. In addition, the commonality between other C2 platforms allows profiles and modules to be easily dropped in without the need for additional development. These features allow both red and blue teams to easily emulate and defend against the APT attack vectors.

### [Fudge: A Collaborative C2 Framework for Purple Teaming](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Network--&--Recon](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Network--&--Recon-gray)  
Fudge is a Python3/Flask web-based C2 framework and Powershell implant designed to facilitate purple teaming activities, post-campaign review and timelining.

Fudges' inception is based on 3 main areas:

Creating a suitable way for blue teamers to review the chronological activities a red team engagement, allowing them to assess if key alerts were missed.
Finding ways to incrementally increase detection rates, allowing defenders to identify the intrusion. This provides a gauge of skill & target areas for upskilling if the intrusion is not identified.
Providing a way for junior testers to experience red teaming without increasing risk to the campaign OpSec/client network.
Purple teaming was born out of the need for tighter integration between offensive and defensive teams. If the red team is successful in compromise, their ability to export the campaign timeline and logging can prove invaluable insight to the blue team. Allowing defenders to review network and host logs as they follow a campaign timeline, allows for blind spots to be identified and tooling adjusted and tuned.

Fudges' implant also supports varying levels and types of obfuscation to allow for varying levels of noise to be made during the engagement to help a SoC benchmark their detection skills.

Lastly, Fudge is designed around team usage, which allows for a senior red teamer to allow another user to have read or read/write access to the campaign. These access controls allow a junior member to view the campaign and see the kind of commands, and techniques used in a post-exploitation environment.

### [GR-LORA: AN OPEN-SOURCE SDR IMPLEMENTATION OF THE LORA PHY](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Network--&--Recon](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Network--&--Recon-gray)  
gr-lora is an open-source GNU Radio/Software Defined Radio implementation of the LoRa radio physical layer, as derived from the author's black box analysis of the protocol. gr-lora empowers developers and security researchers to think beyond packet sniffing and injection by exposing LoRa's physical layer in software.

LoRa is a wireless networking technology that can be thought of as high-endurance cellular for IoT and embedded devices. It utilizes a unique Chirp Spread Spectrum modulation and layered encoding scheme to achieve remarkable range while remaining frugal on power.

PHYs have long been taken for granted, however research such as Travis Goodspeed's packet-in-packet and Dartmouth/River Loop Security's 802.15.4 chipset fingerprinting have demonstrated that physical layer abuse can have severe consequences further up the stack. As a closed protocol, LoRa has only been exposed via layer 2+ interfaces; thus security researchers and developers have lacked the necessary tools to audit and analyze the security and robustness of its PHY.

With its flexible and open architecture, gr-lora gives security researchers the capability required to explore this nascent protocol from its most fundamental layer.


### [Ghost Tunnel: Covert Data Exfiltration Channel to Circumvent Air Gapping - ARSENAL THEATER DEMO](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Network--&--Recon](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Network--&--Recon-gray)  
In recent years, attacking air gapped networks through HID devices is becoming popular. The HID attack uses the USB interface to forge the user's keystrokes or mouse movement to modify the system settings and run malware. In 2009, NSA's Office of Tailored Access Operations (TAO) developed the COTTON-MOUTH – a USB hardware implant which provides a wireless bridge into a target network as well as the ability to load exploit software onto a target machine. Unlike COTTON-MOUTH, Ghost Tunnel attacks the target through the HID device only to release the payload, and it can be removed after the payload is released.

Advantages:

Covertness
HID attack device is only required to release the payload and it can be removed after that
No interference with the target's existing connection status and communications
Can bypass firewalls
Can be used to attack strictly isolated networks
Communication channel does not depend on the target's existing network connection
Cross-Platform Support
Can be used to attack any device with wireless communication module, we tested this attack on Window 7 up to Windows 10, and OSX

By creating a simple tool that performs a man-in-the-middle attack against the HTTP protocol, we can eliminate the need to manually create phishing sites. In addition, this same tool can be used to harvest session cookies from applications that require 2FA, disallow victims from logging out and killing our stolen cookies, hide phishing domains behind legitimate content, categorize phishing domains, serve malware alongside legitimate content, only serve payloads in response to whitelisted requests, and target multiple services at the same time, all without SSL warnings. *Note: This is not just a tool, but a release of a new attack methodology.


### [JavaScript Obfuscation - It's All About the P-a-c-k-e-r-s](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Network--&--Recon](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Network--&--Recon-gray)  
The usage of JavaScript obfuscation techniques have become prevalent in today's threats, from phishing pages, to Magecart, and supply chain injection to JavaScript malware droppers all use JavaScript obfuscation techniques on some level.

The usage of JavaScript obfuscation enables evasion from detection engines and poses a challenge to security professionals, as it hinders them from getting quick answers on the functionality of the examined source code.

Deobfuscation can be technically challenging (sometimes), risky (if you don't know what you are doing), and time consuming (if you are lazy, as I am). Yet, the need to find and analyze high scaled massive attacks using JavaScript obfuscation is a task I'm faced with on a daily basis.

In this arsenal showcase I will present a lazy, performance cost effective approach, focusing on the detection of JavaScript packer templates. Once combined with threat intelligence heuristics, this approach can predict the maliciousness level of JavaScript with high probability of accuracy.

In addition, the showcase will include insights based on detections of the tool that were collected from the threat landscape, including some of the challenges associated with benign websites using obfuscation.

The showcase will also suggest techniques showing how the tool obfuscation detection can also be combined with other threat intelligence signals and heuristics, that can lead to better classification of detect obfuscated code as being malicious.


### [Lauschgerät: Gets in the Way of your Victim's Traffic and Out of Yours](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Network--&--Recon](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Network--&--Recon-gray)  
Lauschgerät gets in the way of your victim and out of yours. This python tool acts as a convenient man-in-the-middle tool to sniff traffic, terminate TLS encryption, host malicious services and bypass 802.1X - provided you have physical access to the victim machine, or at least its network cable.

There are three ways to run it: Either on its own dedicated device like a Raspberry Pi or Banana Pi, in a virtual machine with two physical USB-NICs attached, or on your regular pentest system in its own network namespace. It will look like a completely transparent piece of wire to both victim systems you are getting in the middle of, even if they are using 802.1X because it is implementing the ideas presented in a talk by Alva Lease 'Skip' Duckwall IV.

The Lauschgerät operates with three interfaces: Two interfaces going to the victim client and the victim switch respectively, and one management interface which you can connect to and initiate the redirection of traffic, inject your own traffic, start and stop malicious services, and so forth. It comes with a few services included, such as a service that terminates TLS encryption (which will of course cause a certificate warning on the victim's end) or a service that performs the classic "SSL strip" attack. And more to come!

An optional wireless interfaces can either be used as another management interface or for intercepting traffic of wireless devices. The management can be done via SSH or via a web application, making sure you can hit the ground running.


### [LinkTap: New Threats are Already Around You - The IPV6 Attack Must be Understood](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Network--&--Recon](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Network--&--Recon-gray)  
Due to the exhaustion of IPv4 free address space, the use of IPv6 on the Internet is gradually increasing. All Windows operating systems since Windows Vista have IPv6 enabled by default. IPv6 brings a series of improvements compared to IPV4, but these improvements are also put a double-edged sword.

Recently, we have been focusing on "IPv6" attack research and found that in the IPV6 environment, there are many attack points, such as Iptables will fail, use IPV6 to bypass the Web defense strategy and abuse IPV6-specific protocols for man-in-the-middle attacks, and Other attack ideas!

In this presentation, I will disclose the attack methods and ideas I have found for IPV6, and will also release tools for IPV6 attacks.


### [MacAttack - A Client/Server Framework with Macro Payloads for Domain Recon and Initial Access](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Network--&--Recon](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Network--&--Recon-gray)  
While using macros for malicious purposes is nothing new, this tool provides a suite of payloads ideal for initial recon and footholds that will not burn other methods of attack. MacAttack is a framework that generates payloads for use in Excel and includes client/server communication to perform dynamic alterations at runtime and collate received data.
The payloads included in MacAttack cover a number of areas that have not been published before, including a new stealth technique for hiding payloads, methods for retrieving a user's hash, and performing common recon/early stages attacks such as As-Rep roasting, retrieving documents, browser credentials, password spraying the domain, enumerating users, and domain fronting. The client/server communication and GUI will allow for dynamic checks such as only allowing a password spray to run once or once within a certain time period even if multiple targets enable the payload at the same time, and will provide a visual representation of the enumerated information. Part of the benefit of this tool is that this information is retrievable from a "zero foothold" position - a phishing campaign may be detected or blocked - but this does not burn any existing beacons and the potential rewards can be as great as multiple sets of credentials for users and relevant authentication portals. Microsoft are rolling out changes to macros that have still not been fully deployed by the time of the deadline - and research into these changes and impacts will be included in the discussion. It looks like these changes will only affect O365 to begin with and will include a "recommended policy" to implement.


### [Mallet: An Intercepting Proxy for Arbitrary Protocols](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Network--&--Recon](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Network--&--Recon-gray)  
This prsentation will focus on a new open-source intercepting proxy named Mallet, based on the mature and high-performance Netty framework, that wraps it with a drag and drop graph-based graphical user interface and a datastore. In doing so, we gain access to an existing library of protocol implementations, including TLS (and SNI), various compression algorithms, HTTP, HTTP/2, MQTT, REDIS, and many others, and most important, an existing community of developers creating new protocol decoders and encoders, and the associated body of knowledge in this area.

The Mallet user interface closely follows the Netty model, making it simple to construct a pipeline of encoders and decoders by dragging existing codecs, or adding your own codecs or script blocks to a palette, taking the researcher from a simple TCP intercept-and-forward proxy, to a full-blown protocol stack with scriptable processing, with every change being recorded for review and replay in a subsequent connection. As Netty supports a variety of transports, from the common TCP and UDP to SCTP, Serial Port and File, as well as native kqueue and epoll transports, Mallet can be used to intercept all sorts of data, however you may find it.

Mr.SIP is a simple console based SIP-based Audit and Attack Tool. Originally it was developed to be used in academic work to help developing novel SIP-based DDoS attacks and then as an idea to convert it to a fully functional SIP-based penetration testing tool.

Initially, it was developed to be used in academic researches to help developing novel SIP-based DDoS attacks and then as an idea to convert it to a fully functional SIP-based penetration testing tool. So far it has been used more than 5 journal papers. Mr.SIP can also be used as SIP client simulator and SIP traffic generator.

The initial academic journal paper which Mr.SIP is used is titled "Novel SIP-based DDoS Attacks and Effective Defense Strategies" published in Computers & Security 63 (2016) 29-44 by Elsevier, Science Direct http://sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167404816300980.

In the current state, Mr.SIP comprises 7 sub-modules named as SIP-NES (network scanner), SIP-ENUM (enumerator), SIP-DAS (DoS attack simulator), SIP-ASP (attack scenario player), SIP-EVA (eavesdropper), SIP-SIM (signaling manipulator) and SIP-CRACK (cracker). Since it provides a modular structure to developers, more modules will continue be added by the authors and it is open to be contributed by the open-source developer community.

SIP-NES is a network scanner. It needs the IP range or IP subnet information as input. It sends SIP OPTIONS message to each IP addresses in the subnet/range and according to the responses, it provides the output of the potential SIP clients and servers on that subnet.

SIP-ENUM is a enumerator. It needs the output of SIP-NES and also pre-defined SIP usernames. It generates SIP REGISTER messages and sends them to all SIP components and try to find the valid SIP users on the target network. You can write the output in a file.

SIP-DAS is a DoS/DDoS attack simulator. It comprises four components: powerful spoofed IP address generator, SIP message generator, message sender and response parser. It needs the outputs of SIP-NES and SIP-ENUM along with some pre-defined files.

IP spoofing generator has 3 different options for spoofed IP address generation, i.e., manual, random and by selecting spoofed IP address from subnet. IP addresses could be specified manually or generated randomly. Furthermore, in order to bypass URPF filtering, which is used to block IP addresses that do not belong to the subnet from passing onto the Internet, we designed a spoofed IP address generation module. Spoofed IP generation module calculated the subnet used and randomly generated spoofed IP addresses that appeared to come from within the subnet.

SIP-DAS basically generates legitimate SIP INVITE message and sends it to the target SIP component via TCP or UDP. In the current state it doesn't support instrumentation which helps you to understand the impact of the attack by using Mr.SIP, but we will support it very soon. In the current state, we can see the impact of the attack by checking the CPU and memory usage of the victim SIP server.

SIP is a text based protocol such as HTTP but more complex than HTTP. For example, when we talk about SIP INVITE message, there are some specific headers and parameters need to be vendor specific and unique for each call. SIP Message Generator allows you to bypass security perimeters bu generating all these headers and parameters as it should be, so basic it is harder to be detected by anomaly detection engines that these messages are generated automatically. You can generate SIP methods such as INVITE message, REGISTER message etc.

You can specify the message count, the destination port, you can use predefined toUser list, fromUser list, userAgent list etc.

In order to bypass automatic message generation detection (anomaly detection) systems, random "INVITE" messages are generated that contained no patterns within the messages. Each generated "INVITE" message is grammatically compatible with SIP RFCs and acceptable to all of the SIP components.

"INVITE" message production mechanism specifies the target user(s) in the "To" header of the message. This attack can be executed against a single user or against legitimate SIP users on the target SIP server as an intermediary step before the DoS attack. The legitimate SIP users are enumerated and written to a file. Next, they are placed randomly in the "To" header of the generated "INVITE" messages. "Via, "User-Agent, "From," and "Contact" headers within an "INVITE" message were syntactically generated using randomly selected information from the valid user agent and IP address lists. The tag parameter in the "From" header, the branch and source-port parameters in the "Via" header, and the values in the "Call-ID" header are syntactically and randomly generated using the valid user agent list. In addition, the source IP addresses in the "Contact" and "Via" headers are also generated using IP spoofing.

UDP is used widely in SIP systems as a transport protocol, so attacks on the target server are implemented by sending the generated attack messages in the network using UDP. Also TCP can be used optionally. The message sender of SIP-DAS allows the optional selection of how many SIP messages could be sent during one second. The number of SIP messages sent in one second depended on the resources (CPU and RAM) of the attacker machine.

SIP-ASP is Attack Scenario Player. It is working like a sub function of SIP-DAS. It has a powerful parser and allows you to create stateful SIP attack call flows. In our academic studies, we have developed new attack vectors by using our SIP-DAS and SIP-ASP such as re-transmission based DDoS attacks and reflection based DRDoS attacks.

SIP-EVA is an eavesdropper. It sniffs the target network and can grasp the SIP messages. It allows you to extract call specific information such as who is calling, who i called, the duration of the call, the unique call-ID value and you can even download the media content of the call.

SIP-SIM is a signaling manipulator. It is working like Intercepting SIP Proxy. It uses the same sniffer mechanism with SIP-EVA but it allows you to catch the messages between clients and server and you can replicate the messages and manipulate some headers and/or parameters as you want and send it to the victim server.

By using SIP-SIM you can do do Caller-ID spoofing attacks. SIP-SIM support both LAN-based and WAN-based Caller-ID spoofing attacks. But in order to make WAN-based Caller-ID spoofing attack, you need to have proper service provider account.

SIP-CRACK is a password cracker. Again, it uses the same sniffing mechanism and it allows you to catch the SIP REGISTER messages, extract the authentication data such as hash values. You can do brute-force based cracking, or you can choose dictionary or rainbow table cracking. So SIP is a time critical protocol and cracking should be an offline attack.

### [Mística: Anything is a tunnel if you're brave enough - Covert channels for everyone!](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Network--&--Recon](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Network--&--Recon-gray)  
From exposing internal network ports in restricted environments to the internet to controlling a meterpreter implant via DNS, everything is possible with protocol encapsulation.

To prove this, we have developed Mística, a tool that allows us to finely tune how we want to create a tunnel over protocols like HTTP, DNS and more, and combine this encapsulation with custom applicatrions like io, shell or port redirection.

Mística allows to embed data into other protocol fields, with the goal of establishing a bi-directional channel for arbitrary communications. Mística has a modular design, built around a custom transport protocol, called SOTP (Simple Overlay Transport Protocol). Data is encrypted, chunked and put into SOTP packets. SOTP packets are encoded and embedded into the desired field of the application protocol, and sent to the other end.

During this talk, we will talk about how to quickly design and create covert channels over different protocols and for different purposes. This is both useful for red teams that need new ways to hide their traffic and blue teams that want to easily test their monitoring capabilities.

We will do several demos, where we showcase how encapsulation works and how we can end up tunneling a RAT (meterpreter, in this case) connection over DNS. We will also showcase how to expose any port over the desired covert channel to combine it with tools like Evil-WinRM, for instance.

Mística is available at https://github.com/IncideDigital/Mistica under the GPLv3 license

### [OWFuzz: WiFi Protocol Fuzzing Tool Based on OpenWiFi](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Network--&--Recon](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Network--&--Recon-gray)  
Generally, when using WiFi Fuzzing Tool to test the security of WiFi protocol, you need a WiFi USB dongle that supports monitor mode and set the WiFi USB dongle to monitor mode to listen and inject arbitrary WiFi frames. However, many WiFi USB dongles fail to meet our expectations. For example, some are not stable enough in monitor mode and often get stuck, which leads to the interruption of the fuzzing process. And some, we don't have complete control over some frame fields.

OWFuzz is a WiFi protocol testing tool using OpenWiFi. OpenWiFi is an open-source WiFi protocol stack based on SDR that is fully compatible with Linux mac80211. It's driver takes advantage of the Linux kernel's supports (mac80211, cfg80211) for WiFi high MAC, so it can provide an interface to the application layer like a common WiFi USB dongle. In The hardware part, CSMA/CA protocol and other functions of WiFi low MAC layer are implemented on FPGA. It supports monitoring and injection of arbitrary WiFi frames，The application layer software can also directly communicate with the OpenWiFi driver/FPGA/RF underlying functions through nl80211, which provides users with great autonomous and controllable ability. OWFuzz is the first to use OpenWiFi platform (Xilinx ZC706 dev board + FMCOMMS3) to implements a WiFi protocol fuzzing test framework, which supports the fuzzing test of all WiFi frames and the interactivity testing of WiFi protocols.

This research introduces a comprehensive overview of the OWFuzz. We will introduce its architecture, implementation (arbitrary frame and protocol interactivity fuzzing test), and how it works. And finally we will have a video demonstration.

### [Routopsy: Routing Protocol Vulnerability Analysis and Exploitation](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Network--&--Recon](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Network--&--Recon-gray)  
Routopsy is a new network attack toolkit that leverages a "virtual router" in a Docker container to scan for and attack various networking protocols and misconfigurations. Vulnerabilities include overly broad configured network statements within routing protocols, unauthenticated or plaintext authentication for protocols such as OSPF and HSRP, and the lack of passive interface usage within routing protocols.

Routopsy was designed in a way that will allow users to trivially perform attacks without requiring extensive networking knowledge. Attacks include the injection of new routes, discovery of new networks and gateway takeover attacks which ultimately could lead to Person-in-the-Middle attacks. Additionally, a fully-fledged router interface is also available for more experienced users and for more advanced attacks.

Internally, Routopsy leverages a "virtual router" which has been around for a number of years, is well maintained and supports a variety of protocols. Once the scan phase of Routopsy is complete a simple configuration is loaded within the virtual router and used to attack the target protocol.


### [SCAVENGER: A Post-Exploitation Scanning/Mapping Tool](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Network--&--Recon](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Network--&--Recon-gray)  
SCAVENGER is a multi-threaded post-exploitation scanning tool for mapping systems and finding "interesting" and most frequently used files, folders and services. Once credentials are gained, it can scan remote systems (Linux, Windows and OSX) via services like SMB and SSH to scrape that system looking for "interesting" things and then cache the result. SCAVENGER has the ability to find the newest files that have been accessed/modified/created and keep the result in an ordered database. Then, after time has passed, hours or days later the systems can be scanned again. SCAVENGER can then compare the previous list of "newest files" to the latest list of "newest files." This gives the user the ability to find the "interesting" and most frequently files used on that system, for example password files being accessed by an administrator or heavily used credit card database files.

Whilst looking for "interesting" files, folder and services, SCAVENGER scans these filenames and their content for various "interesting" phrases, for example "password" or "secret." Once detected SCAVENGER then downloads the "interesting" file to the local system. At the same time SCAVENGER also scans for Card Holder Data and also downloads the file if Card Holder Data is found.

Future features will be the addition of services like NFS, FTP and database connections. Also adding more capability of retrieving passwords from remote Linux or Windows systems, without touching to the disk of the remote system. And without reinventing the wheel using SCAVENGER as a wrapper to use on Windows systems performing more post-exploitation techniques.

SMBeagle is an SMB file share auditing and enumeration tool that rapidly hunts out file shares and inventories their contents. Built from a desire to find poorly protected files, SMBeagle casts the spotlight on files vulnerable to ransomware, watering hole attacks and which may contain sensitive credentials.

SMBeagle hunts out all files it can see in the network and reports if the file can be read and/or written. All these findings are streamed out to either a CSV file or an elasticsearch host?

Businesses of all sizes often have file shares with awful file permissions.

Large businesses have sprawling file shares and its common to find sensitive data with misconfigured permissions and small businesses often have a small NAS in the corner of the office with no restrictions at all!

SMBeagle crawls these shares and lists out all the files it can read and write. If it can read them, so can ransomware.

SMBeagle can provide penetration testers with the less obvious routes to escalate privileges and move laterally.

By outputting directly into elasticsearch, testers can quickly find readable scripts and writeable executables.

Finding watering hole attacks and unprotected passwords never felt so easy!


### [Scapy: Python-Based Interactive Packet Manipulation Program + Library](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Network--&--Recon](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Network--&--Recon-gray)  
Scapy (https://github.com/secdev/scapy) is a renowned packet manipulation tool written in Python that supports a wide number of protocols on many different platforms (Linux, macOS, *BSD, and Windows). Initially developed by Philippe Biondi since 2003, it is now maintained by Guillaume Valadon, Pierre Lalet and Gabriel Potter. While the existence of this tool is well-known, its grip is much less, to the community's detriment. This presentation aims at filling this gap using practical and detailed examples.


### [SecScanC2 -- Manage Assesment to Create P2P Network for Security Scanning & C2](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Network--&--Recon](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Network--&--Recon-gray)  
In the realm of security attack and defense, as well as penetration testing, two key challenges often arise. Firstly, attack scanning is frequently detected by defensive security systems, resulting in the scanning IP being blocked. Secondly, when defensive assets are controlled and connected back to the command and control (C2) server, security devices may detect the connection, leading to countermeasures against penetration testers. To address these challenges and enable safe, efficient asset detection and secure connections to controlled assets, we have enhanced the Kademlia protocol and developed a Distributed Hash Table (DHT) technology.

Our hacking tool is highly effective during attack scanning, consisting of a large number of Internet nodes that dynamically update IDs and node tree structures at regular intervals. This approach allows each session to initiate requests from different nodes during the scanning process, thus avoiding IP blocking due to high-frequency scanning. Moreover, when connecting controlled assets back to the C2 server, nodes are randomly selected based on a user-defined hop count, effectively preventing penetration testers from being traced and significantly enhancing the stealthiness of the entire penetration testing process.


### [SharpSCCM](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Network--&--Recon](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Network--&--Recon-gray)  
SharpSCCM is an open-source C# utility for interacting with SCCM, inspired by the PowerSCCM project by @harmj0y, @jaredcatkinson, @enigma0x3, and @mattifestation. This tool can be used to demonstrate the impact of configuring SCCM without the recommended security settings, which can be found here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/configmgr/core/clients/deploy/plan/security-and-privacy-for-clients

Currently, SharpSCCM supports the NTLMv2 coercion attack techniques noted in this post (https://posts.specterops.io/coercing-ntlm-authentication-from-sccm-e6e23ea8260a), as well as the attack techniques noted in this post (https://enigma0x3.net/2016/02/29/offensive-operations-with-powersccm/), which have been modified to coerce NTLMv2 authentication rather than running PowerShell on the target. SharpSCCM can also be used to dump information about the SCCM environment from a client, including the plaintext credentials for Network Access Accounts.

Research is ongoing to add SharpSCCM features to:
- pull and decrypt Network Access Account credentials from SCCM servers using a low-privileged account on any client machine
- execute actions in SCCM environments that require PKI certificates to secure client/server communications
- escalate privileges from local administrator on site servers to SCCM Full Administrator

![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Network--&--Recon](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Network--&--Recon-gray)  
The security-related search engines like Shodan, Censys or ZoomEye are daily cybersecurity research tools. They can be used to gather information within threat Intelligence, discover vulnerable hosts, craft fingerprints for vulnerability scanners. At the same time, such search engines have some fundamental limitations and constraints leading to blind spots, false negatives and wrong results. It is very disappointing, especially when new research has been started and the cost of a mistake could be days or even weeks spent in the wrong direction.

The Grinder Framework is an open-source security research toolkit adopted to Internet-wide surveys and allows you to use the full power of tools like Nmap, Shodan, Censys, Vulners, TLS-attacker and bringing the light through tailored scanning and threat intelligence approach. The Grinder was born in the SD-WAN New Hope project when we explored SD-WAN security on the Internet.

In this talk, we will describe the essence of the Grinder framework and show how you can employ it in your security researches. We will consider the blind spots of the modern search engines, describe non-trivial use cases we worked out during our Internet-scale surveys and illustrate new features by examples from the SD-WAN New Hope, AIsec and DICOMSec projects.

WIG (Wi-Fi Information Gathering) is a free and open source (GPLv3) utility for IEEE 802.11 device fingerprinting. WIG uses Wi-Fi network interfaces that supports monitor mode to obtain information on nearby devices with Wi-Fi support. The tool supports vendors proprietary protocols such as Apple AirDrop/AirPlay, Cisco Client eXtensions, Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS) and Wi-Fi Direct. Using these protocols the tool is able to find and fingerprint potential Wi-Fi targets that other tools are not able to find. The tool output it's useful on the threat modeling phase during wi-fi penetration testing or to find potential targets during a network assessment.


### [WMIHacker: A New Way to Use 135 Port Lateral Movement Bypass AV and Transfer File](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Network--&--Recon](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Network--&--Recon-gray)  
After the eternal blue virus flood, most intranets no longer open port 445, so the 135-port DCOM service becomes another exploitable point. We need a tool or method that can use 135 ports to execute commands and the Ability to transfer files. WMIHacker is such a tool and can bypass av.

Remote command execution tools such as psexec (sysinternals) and wmiexec (impacket) are frequently used during lateral movement. However, these tools will be killed by anti-virus software and the command executed will fail. Psexec will create services and leaves a lot of logs, including a lot of operations such as service creation. The way win32_process.create used by wmiexec.py will no doubt be blocked by AV. I found a new way to execute commands on a machine with an AV and can overwrite window2003 to the latest version of windows. Because I use VBScript to run it. There is no doubt that someone is studying the same content as I did. I found that there are many ways to execute on the internet, including deriving win32_process, registering COM and making it as a malicious provider, msi abuse, etc., but these known ways of using Being intercepted by av.


### [WMImplant: An Offensive Use Case of WMI](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Network--&--Recon](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Network--&--Recon-gray)  
When looking forward to the latest defenses that are being seen in environments all over the world today, we're consistently seeing EDR, "Next-Gen AV", and application whitelisting. Of the available defenses, application whitelisting seemed like the most interesting challenge to undertake. We wanted to build something that would work against one of the best application whitelisting solutions from a detection/prevention perspective, Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC), previously known as Device Guard.

WDAC aims to lock down Windows workstations via multiple methods, one example is digital signature based rule enforcement when determining if an application is allowed to execute. Another, is that WDAC automatically enforces PowerShell into Constrained Language Mode (CLM), a severely restricted version of PowerShell. So how can you operate in a restricted WDAC environment?

WMImplant is one possible answer. Why not leverage a service that is built in to Windows and enabled by default since the days of Windows Server 2000? Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) enables us to execute commands on systems, remotely and locally. WIth the enforcement of PowerShell Constrained Langauge Mode (CLM), our PowerShell based code had to adhere to the restrictions of the language mode. WMImplant is fully PowerShell CLM compliant and is designed to provide a Meterpreter-esque menu for users to easily perform post-exploitation tasks against the targeted system.

Come learn how a CLM compliant code-base designed to operate exclusively over WMI can allow you to survive and thrive in a heavily restricted application whitelisting environment.

### [When World War II meets CDNs: A New Class of Pulsing DDoS Attack](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Network--&--Recon](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Network--&--Recon-gray)  
Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) are commonly believed to offer their customers protection against denial of service (DoS) attacks. However, our research reveals a novel architecture vulnerability in CDNs, enabling attackers to turn globally distributed CDN Infrastructure into powerful DDoS amplifiers.

In this talk, we draw the analogy to a military tactic used in World War II and introduce a new class of pulsing denial-of-service attacks. We demonstrate how CDNs can be exploited to concentrate low-rate attacking requests into short, high-bandwidth pulse waves, resulting in a pulsing DDoS attack to saturate targeted TCP services periodically.

We tested five leading CDN vendors and found all of them are susceptible to this attack. By mounting an attack against our own Web site, we show that attackers can use it to achieve peak bandwidths over 1000 times greater than their upload bandwidth, seriously degrading the performance and availability of target services. We have reported our findings to all tested CDNs and received positive feedback.

As this problem is rooted in the inherent nature of CDN forwarding networks, it is difficult to eliminate entirely. We discuss possible mitigation strategies for this emerging threat. We believe it is important that CDN operators and their customers be aware of this attack so that they can protect themselves accordingly.

![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Reverse--Engineering](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Reverse--Engineering-gray)  
APKiD is like "PEiD" for Android applications. It gives information on how an APK was built by fingerprinting compilers, packers, obfuscators, and protectors. The main idea behind the tool is to help provide context on how the APK was potentially built or changed after it was built. This is all context useful for attributing authorship and finding patterns.

Extracting information about how the APK was made, it can provide a lot of information to assess the healthiness of an Android application (e.g. malware or pirated). The framework is the combination of a bunch of Yara rules and Python wrappers that scan files within APKs. Mainly, APKiD unpacks files and explores AndroidManifest.xml, DEX and ELF files to match rules and offers results based on them.

![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Reverse--Engineering](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Reverse--Engineering-gray)  
Vulnerability researchers conducting security assessments on software will often harness the capabilities of coverage-guided fuzzing through powerful tools like AFL++ and libFuzzer. This is important as it automates the bughunting process and reveals exploitable conditions in targets quickly. However, when encountering large and complex codebases or closed-source binaries, researchers have to painstakingly dedicate time to manually audit and reverse engineer them to identify functions where fuzzing-based exploration can be useful.

Fuzzable is a framework that integrates both with C/C++ source code and binaries to assist vulnerability researchers in identifying function targets that are viable for fuzzing. This is done by applying several static analysis-based heuristics to pinpoint risky behaviors in the software and the functions that executes them. Researchers can then utilize the framework to generate basic harness templates, which can then be used to hunt for vulnerabilities, or to be integrated as part of a continuous fuzzing pipeline, such as Google's oss-fuzz.

In addition to running as a standalone tool, Fuzzable is also integrated as a plugin for Binary Ninja, with support for other disassembly backends being developed.


### [BINGREP](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Reverse--Engineering](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Reverse--Engineering-gray)  
We created a new tool for static malware analysis. Incident response is important and analysts must analyze malware promptly, but the cost of static analysis is too expensive. For effective analysis we sometimes reuse malware that was analyzed before. "BinDiff" is the most famous tool created by H. Flake that outputs "Diff" of functions between two malware. This outputs good results, but it can output only one result per function. So, we created "BinGrep" that outputs functions in order of similarity by searching resemble malware functions. This "Grep" tool is useful in malware analysis because malware analysts are interested in specific functions.


### [Bringing the X86 Complete RE Experience to Smart Contract](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Reverse--Engineering](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Reverse--Engineering-gray)  
Currently there is more than 2 Trillion USD market cap for the crypto currency market, DeFi alone is more than 100 Billion. With the popularity of the DeFi market, smart contracts again become the playground of hackers and security researchers. Token "robbery" became the most problematic issue for both investors and crypto currency exchange.

Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is still the most widely used architect to support the core of smart contracts such as Polkadot, EVM and soon Cardano blockchain. Emulators built around EVM are merely good for development purposes. Most of the EVM analysis engines are just debugging tools based on symbolic execution. Unfortunately, these engines are just simple tools that do not encourage and support us to develop tools on top of them.

During Black Hat Asia, Arsenal 2021, we presented "Qiling: Smart Analysis for Smart Contract" [1] and explained the foundation of Qiling's EVM engine. In Blackhat USA Arsenal 2021, we would like to take this opportunity to demonstrate the full capabilities and tools that we build on top of the Qiling's EVM engine. That brings the complete traditional X86 reverse engineering experience to the smart contract space.

- Real time EVM debugger, with step into, step over and memory stack modification capabilities
- Full emulation of multi cross contract instrumentation
- Ultra fast emulation with pre-set environment variable
- Fully automated reapply and verify latest smart contract attack to all existing contract on a exchange or chain
- Make symbolic execution to work with Qiling EVM engine to provide a more in depth emulation
- Added a fully functional LLVM Intermediate Representation(IR). It allow a users to build a ultra fast fuzzer on-top of Qiling Framework.

To demonstrate the power of our framework and tools. We prepared some case study and demo on how we can rebuild the entire blockchain and verify the currently existing smart contract against the latest attack being discovered in the wild in the matters on few lines of code.

Once the talk ends, we will release the code and tools into the Qiling github repo, as usual.

### [CAN-PICK - A VISUALIZATION TOOL FOR EVALUATING CAN-BUS CYBERSECURITY - ARSENAL THEATER DEMO](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Reverse--Engineering](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Reverse--Engineering-gray)  
With the development of automotive technology, vehicles become more electronic and intelligent on the basis of inner bus communication network, and they draw more attention to the study of automotive cybersecurity. To facilitate this process, we developed a tool that evaluates the cybersecurity of the CAN-bus, which can be used for black-box tests by security researchers and automotive engineers.

This tool is capable of sniffing CAN-bus packets, analyzing UDS, as well as launching fuzzing attacks, and brute-force attacks. Fuzzing attack has two modes; we can combine id with data or single one to fuzz CAN-bus packet. By visualizing the changes from different packets, it can help us to identify id and value range related with function quickly. And we can easily find out which data is encrypted, so that it’ll more convenient to guess encrypt algorithm. Users can also share their programmable examples within the tool. This talk will introduce the reverse engineering of CAN-bus and present the "CAN-Pick" tool by demonstrations of injecting CAN-bus packets on a car. We will show some videos to prove the results of our work. This tool can also be used as a remote access tool, which can realize full control over the car without adding any actuators on the vehicle in some modern car via Telematics system.


### [CryptGrep: Rapidly Search a Cryptographic Function to Analyze Malware](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Reverse--Engineering](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Reverse--Engineering-gray)  
'CryptGrep' is an IDA python script which makes it possible to search a cryptography function to analyze malware rapidly. There are many existing implementations such as 'FindCrypt' (http://www.hexblog.com/?p=28) and 'idascope' (https://github.com/nihilus/idascope) which take an approach to find cryptographic magic number statically.

But, there are some cryptographic algorithm that doesn't use a magic number such as RC4, or malware can also hide the magic number. We needed another tool that can apply for these malware. The same malware family usually use the same cryptographic algorithm, and don't change their algorithm and implementation so frequently. Therefore, CryptGrep adopted signature based approach. Our approach also uses improved 'BinGrep' algorithm that was specialized for cryptographic function using several heuristic technique.

We created several pre-set signatures for typical malware. The usage is very simple and easy. And if you need additional signature, you can also create your original signature using your malware.


### [DaaS: Decompilation as a Service](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Reverse--Engineering](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Reverse--Engineering-gray)  
"Decompilation-as-a-Service" or "DaaS" is a tool designed to change the way of file decompiling. An analyst usually decompiles malware samples one by one using a program with a GUI. That's pretty good when dealing with a few samples, but it becomes really tedious to do with larger amounts. Not to mention if you have to decompile different types of files, with different tools and even different operating systems. Besides, lots of decompilers cannot be integrated with other programs because they do not have proper command line support.

DaaS aims to solve all those problems at the same time. The most external layer of DaaS is docker-compose, so it can run on any OS with Docker support. All the other components run inside Docker so now we can integrate the decompiler with any program on the same computer. In addition, we developed an API to use DaaS from the outside, so you can also connect the decompiler with programs from other computers and use the decompiler remotely. In our particular case at Deloitte Threat Intelligence team, we needed to decompile thousands of samples received from different systems and to be able to distribute processing and dynamically scale our capabilities.

Although the tool's modular architecture allows you to easily create workers for decompiling many different file types, we started with the most challenging problem: decompile .NET executables. To accomplish that, we used Wine on a Docker container to run Windows decompilers flawlessly on a Linux environment. In addition, on Windows some programs create useless or invisible windows in order to work, so we needed to add xvfb (x11 virtual frame buffer; a false x11 environment) to wrap those decompilers and avoid crashes on our pure command line environment. This allows you to install DaaS in any machine without desktop environment and be able to use any decompiler anyway.

You can access the tool's source code at: https://github.com/codexgigassys/daas


### [Deoptfuscator: Automated Deobfuscation of Android Bytecode using Compilation Optimization](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Reverse--Engineering](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Reverse--Engineering-gray)  
Code obfuscation is a technique that makes programs harder to understand. Malware writers widely the obfuscation technique to evade detection from anti-malware software, or to deter reverse engineering attempts for their malicious code. Typical obfuscation techniques applied to Android malicious apps include identifier renaming, string encryption, control-flow obfuscation, and Java reflection (API hiding). If we de-obfuscate the obfuscated code and restore it to the original code before obfuscation was applied, we can analyze the obfuscated malware effectively and efficiently.

Therefore, we have developed Deoptfuscator, an effective tool for de-obfuscating the Android applications that have been transformed using control-flow obfuscation mechanisms. That is, it can reverse the control-flow obfuscation of Android APKs.

The features of Deoptfuscator are as follows:
- Deoptfuscator can detect obfuscation traces (especially, opaque predicates) utilizing the optimization approach of Android ART's ahead-of-time (AOT) compiler. It effectively optimizes the control flow of an obfuscated app using ReDex as well as the detected obfuscation traces.
- If the obfuscated Android app can run on a device, the de-obfuscated app reversed by Deoptfuscator can run on the device too.
- Deoptfuscator can reverse the control-flow obfuscation techniques of DexGuard that other de-obfuscation tools haven't.
- If Deoptfuscator is used in conjunction with other de-obfuscators such as DeGuard that can reverse identifier renaming of Android APKs, it can be a more powerful de-obfuscation tool.

### [Ghidra-EVM: Reversing Smart Contracts with Ghidra](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Reverse--Engineering](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Reverse--Engineering-gray)  
In the last few years, attacks on deployed smart contracts in the Ethereum blockchain have ended up in a significant amount of stolen funds due to programming mistakes. Since smart contracts, once compiled and deployed, are complex to modify and update different practitioners have suggested the importance of reviewing their security in the blockchain where only Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) bytecode is available. In this respect, reverse engineering through disassemble and decompilation can be effective.

Ghidra-EVM is a Ghidra module for reverse engineering smart contracts. It can be used to download Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) bytecode from the Ethereum blockchain and disassemble and decompile the smart contract. Further, it can analyze creation code, find contract methods and locate insecure instructions.


### [Glyph - An Architecture Independent Binary Analysis Tool for Fingerprinting Functions Through NLP](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Reverse--Engineering](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Reverse--Engineering-gray)  
Reverse engineering is an important task performed by security researchers to identify vulnerable functions and malicious functions in IoT (Internet of Things) devices that are often shared across multiple devices of many system architectures. Common techniques to currently identify the reuse of these functions do not perform cross-architecture identification unless specific data such as unique strings are identified that may be of use in identifying a piece of code. Utilizing natural language processing techniques, Glyph allows you to upload an ELF binary (32 & 64 bit) for cross-architecture function fingerprinting, upon analysis, a web-based function symbol table will be created and presented to the user to aid in their analysis of binary executables/shared objects.

![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Reverse--Engineering](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Reverse--Engineering-gray)  
As well known, object files are generated by c/c++ compiler or assembler from source code, and linked into an executable binary. But now, I can directly dump multiple object files just from one executable binary (exe, dll, ...) by using this tool. What's more amazing is that they can be linked again to a new binary, which is almost same as the old one !

It is designed mainly for SBI (Static Binary Instrumenation), to collect code coverage and integrate with popular fuzzing engines (AFL, honggfuzz, ...). Of course, it is faster than all of the DBI solutions.

### [Ox4Shell - Deobfuscate Log4Shell payloads with ease](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Reverse--Engineering](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Reverse--Engineering-gray)  
Since the release of the Log4Shell vulnerability (CVE-2021-44228), many tools were created to obfuscate Log4Shell payloads, making the lives of security engineers a nightmare.

Threat actors tend to apply obfuscation techniques to their payloads for several reasons. Most security protection tools, such as web application firewalls (WAFs), rely on rules to match malicious patterns. By using obfuscated payloads, threat actors are able to circumvent the rules logic and bypass security measures. Moreover, obfuscated payloads increase analysis complexity and, depending upon the degree of obfuscation, can also prevent them from being reverse-engineered.

Decoding and analyzing obfuscated payloads is time-consuming and often results in inaccurate data. However, doing so is crucial for understanding attackers' intentions.

We believe that security teams around the world can benefit from using Ox4Shell to dramatically reduce their analysis time. To help the security community, we have decided to release Ox4Shell - a payload deobfuscation tool that would make your life much easier.

### [ParseAndC 2.0 – We Don't Need No C Programs (for Parsing)](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Reverse--Engineering](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Reverse--Engineering-gray)  
This is the 2.0 version of the ParseAndC tool that was presented in BH and DEFCON last year, with many new features added. The 1.0 version was capable of mapping any C structure(s) to any datastream, and then visually displaying the 1:1 correspondence between the variables and the data in a very colorful, intuitive display so that it was very easy to understand which field had what value.

In 2.0 version, we essentially expand the C language so that C structures alone has the same power as full-fledged C programs. We introduce Dynamic structure, which changes depending on what data it has seen till now. It supports variable-sized array, variable-sized bitfield, and addition/deletion of struct members depending on what value the previous struct members have. Suppose we are parsing the network packets, and after we decode the IP header, depending on the protocol field this tool can automatically decode the next header as either the TCP or UDP. We also add speculative execution, where user just provides the key expected values of certain fields (like magic numbers, mentioned by C initializations), and the tool automatically finds out from which offset to map so that all fields indeed have the expected value.

This tool is extremely portable – it's a single Python 1MB text file, is cross-platform (Windows/Mac/Unix), and also works in the terminal /batch mode without GUI or Internet connection. The tool is self-contained - it doesn't import anything, to the extent that it implements its own C compiler (front-end) from scratch!!

This tool is useful for both security- and non-security testing alike (reverse engineering, network traffic analyzing, packet processing etc.). It is currently being used at Intel widely. The author of this tool led many security hackathons at Intel and there this tool was found to be very useful.

Apple has introduced Fairplay DRM into App Store apps since 2013. For a long time before, a jailbroken IOS device is necessary for decrypting DRM protected app, which brings many problems for security researchers and malware analysts. And Apple's property DRM implementation and other components are highly protected with LLVM-based obfuscation, the lack of review and research may also leaves the vulnerability lasting. With the release of highly iOS-similar Apple Silicon device, we are able to explore more secrets of hardware and software on Apple platforms. My work will cover on three parts: firstly, how Fairplay DRM works and how to make a DRM decryption system on M1 Mac without breaking the system; secondly, possible attack surface of FairplayIOKit; and lastly, what methods Apple uses to obfuscate their property software and attack the weakness.

![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Reverse--Engineering](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Reverse--Engineering-gray)  
Code instrumentation is expensive work, especially when a target application is large and complex, or even impossible if you don't know the build environment or source code.

This technique, non-invasive code instrumentation, leverages two known techniques: Reflective DLL Injection and Microsoft Detours, enabling you to inject arbitrary code at arbitrary places without re-compiling the target application.

The project consists of two parts: DLL injector and Injectee DLL. You can write your own logic(s) to run and interact with the code of the target process in Assembly and/or C++ and embed it into a DLL file, which can be injected into any user-mode process running on Windows x86 or x64. After injected, the Detours' part of the DLL dynamically re-routes the target's code to run your logic.

Linux, ARM, or kernel-mode is not supported. Injection into Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge will be demonstrated.

### [QiLing: Lightweight Advanced Binary Analyzer](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Reverse--Engineering](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Reverse--Engineering-gray)  
Analyzing binaries mostly rely on high level user tools. At the same time, you need to run the binary on the same target architecture & platform. These restrictions limit advanced automatic analysis, require special hardware resources (such as for IoT analysis), and also expose against malicious binaries.

QIling is a sandbox framework that focuses on providing high level Python API to enable users to build highly customizable analysis tool on top. Using emulator technology inside, our engine can run any machine code on any target platforms. This allows analyzing Windows malware on Linux Arm64, or running IoT firmware based on Mips on MacOS, and so on.

This research introduces a comprehensive overview on the Qiling. We will present all the technical issues we had to deal with, including emualating operating system layers such as syscalls, loader and linker, how qiling supports all executable file formats (PE, MachO, ELF, UEFI and MBR), and finally how we provide a framework for users to easily build their analysis tools on top of this foundation.

To conclude the presentation, we will show some cool live demos, such as:

Run IDA on top of Qiling of with Qiling's IDA scriptable plugin
Emulate, debug and instrument MBR from Qiling Framework


### [Qiling Framework: Deep Dive Into Obfuscated Binary Analysis](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Reverse--Engineering](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Reverse--Engineering-gray)  
Modern obfuscation techniques are getting more and more challenged. Existing static techniques are no longer sufficient to analyze binary in heavy obfuscated form. To address this issue, we have to provide security analysts with the ability to perform high-fidelity emulation and sophisticated binary instrumentation framework.

Qiling Framework (https://qiling.io) is an advanced sandboxed emulator framework. It encloses a rich set of Python APIs that allow security analysts to develop highly customizable analysis tools with minimal implementation efforts. With the facilitation of the emulation technology in Qiling, our engine can run arbitrary executables in a cross-platform-architecture fashion. As such, security analysts could use it to analyze various executable file-formats, including Windows PE, MachO, ELF, UEFI, MBR, etc.

Since we released Qiling Framework in Nov 2019, our project has received significant attention from the community. Currently, we have about 60+ contributors and almost 1,700 followers on GitHub.

This session shares the latest update on Qiling Framework, focusing on deobfuscating binaries. We will demonstrate how we can provide instant support for presenting code execution flow in the form of intermediate representations (e.g., IDA Pro or R2). Thanks to some advanced features of Qiling Framework, security analysts can use a series of newly added APIs to ease their efforts in reverse engineering. To conclude, we have few live demos to show how to deal with some real sophisticated binaries.

I. Syscall, Operating System API and Library Hijack

We will demonstrate how we can use different APIs in Qiling Framework to intercept a binary function and hijack its execution. By intercepting a binary function, we meant intercepting a library function or syscall at the stage of pre-execution, execution, and post-execution, without the restrictions imposed by the OS or underlying computing architecture.


II. Save and Restore Current Binary Emulation States

Sophisticated binaries impose significant challenges for reverse engineering. With the facilitation of a save-and-restore feature in Qiling Framework, security analysts are able to save and resume an emulation state at any stage. This provides the reverse engineering professionals with the ability to avoid repeatedly running a binary from the beginning state. Given the program state entering into a branch (e.g., taking a jump with jz, jnz, and other branch-taken instructions), Qiling can always save the necessary program state and enable program resume later on.


III. ollvm de-flattern techniques

ollvm is a well-known obfuscation tool. One of its obfuscation techniques is Control Flow Flattening. With Qiling emulation, we can search real control flow and restore it easily. Thanks to the newly added feature to present control flow in an intermediate representation (like IDA microcode API, R2 ESIL, VEX, and etc), the new version of Qiling will make such de-flattern techniques cross-architecture.


### [Qiling: Smart Analysis for Smart Contract](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Reverse--Engineering](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Reverse--Engineering-gray)  
Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is the most widely used architect to support the core of smart contracts. Many existing EVM emulators are just debugging tools based on symbolic execution. Unfortunately, these engines are just simple tools that do not encourage and support us to develop tools on top of them.

To raise the bar, we extended Qiling [1] to support EVM smart contracts (so Qiling is not just limited to analyze machine binary code, but also works for smart contracts) . Our framework offers some key features as follows.

- Analyze smart contracts only with their bytecode, without requiring source codes.
- Can instrument smart contracts at various level: instruction, code, event and activity
- Rule based dynamic smart contract analysis
- Not just limited to EVM smart contracts, but is also compatible with other EVM based smart contracts, supporting modern smart contract requirements.

In this talk, we will present our instrument-able EVM based smart contract framework. With our framework, users will be able to build all kinds of tools on top of it. For example, one could develop a scanner to test the corresponding smart contracts and even perform an automated analysis against smart contracts.

To demonstrate the power of our framework, we built an ultra-fast fuzzer for smart contract, using coverage guided technique. We extended the traditional binary fuzzer named AFL for this. Our fuzzer can efficiently discover typical vulnerabilities in EVM smart contracts, without requiring contract source code.

![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Reverse--Engineering](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Reverse--Engineering-gray)  
A microcontroller unit (MCU) is a small computer on a single metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) integrated circuit (IC) chip. It is widely used in various types of devices, appliances, automobiles, and many more. Recently MCU security has been raised as a major concern among users and operators, as MCU vulnerabilities can be catastrophic. For this reason, it is important to audit MCU code for security issues. Unfortunately, due to the limited resources on MCU, the on-device test for MCU is not feasible. Besides, there are no emulation solutions able to provide a full instrumentation analysis platform for MCU firmware.

On the other hand, the tight coupling between MCU and hardware peripherals makes it difficult to build an MCU firmware emulator. This greatly hinders the application of dynamic analysis tools in firmware analysis, such as fuzzing.

This talk discusses how we emulated MCU emulation without real peripheral hardware. This requires to model peripheral's registers and interrupts, and implements their internal logic based on the official peripheral documentation and hardware abstraction layer (HAL). We can now emulate widely used MCU chips from top MCU vendors such as STM, Atmel, NXP, and so on. Each of them includes a diverse set of peripherals, including UART, I2C, SPI, ADC, Ethernet, SD Card, Timer, etc.

Upon our emulation, we built several analysis tools for various firmware formats, such as ELF, Binary, and Intel Hex, which are widely used in MCU libraries (RTOS, Arduino, Protocol Stack, etc). We are able to perform advanced tasks, such as:

- Instrument and hijack MCU's activities (e.g, reads and writes to peripherals).
- Save and restore current peripheral/execution states (e.g. register and interrupts).
- Supports multi-threaded firmware, such as RTOS.
- Hijack the interrupts from peripherals, so users can control the scheduling policy of multi-threaded firmware.

To demonstrate the power of our work, we will have live demos to show some exciting cases:

- Emulate MCU with external devices via SPI. UART and I2C
- Fuzz MCU firmware to find 0days with a customized AFL fuzzer.
- Password brute forcing for MCU firmware
- To solve some MCU challenges on CTFs

New code and demo will be released after the talk.


### [SHAREM: Advanced Windows Shellcode Analysis Framework with Ghidra Plugin](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Reverse--Engineering](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Reverse--Engineering-gray)  
Shellcode can be cryptic, especially when encoded. Understanding its functionality is not straightforward. SHAREM is a cutting-edge Shellcode Analysis Framework, with both emulation and its own disassembler. SHAREM's unprecedented capabilities can allow us to unravel the mysteries of shellcode in new ways not seen.

Windows syscalls have become trendy in offensive security, yet SHAREM is the only tool that can emulate and log all user-mode Windows syscalls. Additionally, SHAREM also emulates and logs thousands of WinAPI functions. SHAREM is the only shellcode tool to parse and discover not only parameters, but also entire structures passed as parameters. SHAREM doesn't present parameters as hexadecimal values, but converts each to human readable format, in vivid colors.

Disassemblers like IDA Pro and Ghidra can be poor at disassembling shellcode accurately. SHAREM's disassembler is significantly more accurate with its original analysis capabilities. SHAREM additionally can uniquely integrate emulation results to provide flawless disassembly. Novel signature identifications are used to identify each function in the shellcode, and parameter values. SHAREM uses unique capabilities to accurately identify data, presenting data the correct way, not as misinterpreted instructions. SHAREM also uniquely provides complete-code coverage via emulation, capturing all functionality.

New at Arsenal, we will release a new script that allows SHAREM's output to be ingested by Ghidra. While Ghidra can handle shellcode in some cases, it simply cannot beat a framework specifically designed to handle and emulate shellcode. As such, this new release leverages SHAREM's advanced capabilities. Additionally, major updates include revamped complete-code coverage, timeless debugging of stack, nearly doubling the number of supported WinAPIs.

SHAREM provides unprecedented capabilities with encoded shellcode. Not only does it fully deobfuscate shellcode through emulation, discovering WinAPIs and syscalls, but it automatically recovers the shellcode's deobfuscated form. SHAREM presents error-free disassembly of its decoded form, with function calls and parameters labelled.


### [SafeNet - Securing Your Network From Your Research](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Reverse--Engineering](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Reverse--Engineering-gray)  
In the world of Cyber Security and especially malware research and reverse engineering, we often put ourselves and our PCs at constant risk, and a common method to mitigate this is by using a Virtual Machine and while this method is great for keeping our PCs safe, it does not address a larger issue - our network.

This is true especially now, with the rise in popularity of remote and hybrid work where we have to research on networks that lack corporate-level protection solutions like our homes!

SafeNet is a solution to keep our research labs and dirty virtual machines connected to the internet, all while segregating them from our local network and keeping it safe, ensuring that we can continue researching while staying as safe as possible.

Snake is a malware storage zoo that was built out of the need for a centralized and unified storage solution for malicious samples that could seamlessly integrate into the investigation pipeline. Snake utilizes a plugin system to provide extensive static analysis capability along with interface capability to allow interaction with 3rd party platforms, such as Cuckoo. Snake adheres to the RESTful API philosophy and as a result allows for seamless interaction with 3rd party tools from within a single UI. It provides enough information to allow analysts to quickly and efficiently pivot to the most suitable tools for the task at hand.


### [Stantinko deobfuscation arsenal](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Reverse--Engineering](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Reverse--Engineering-gray)  
Stantinko is a malware family, which has been active since at least 2012, and has been gradually improving its code obfuscation techniques to hinder analysis and detection – especially in its recent versions. The half-million-strong Stantinko botnet has been used by its operators for various cybercriminal activities, including click fraud, ad injection, social network fraud, password stealing attacks, and cryptomining.

Stantinko's custom obfuscation techniques can be divided into four categories: control-flow flattening, string obfuscation, do-nothing code, and dead code, strings and resources. The techniques are employed in both x86 and x64 versions of the malware and we'll focus particularly on the first two.

These control-flow-flattening loops generally merge multiple functions into one. They transform the control flow to a form that is hard to read and the execution order of basic blocks is unpredictable without extensive analysis.

Stantinko's string obfuscation technique resembles construction of strings on the stack, but it additionally uses standard C functions for string manipulation with various decoy words and sentences to compose the final string.

These enhancements to the otherwise common obfuscations are what make them unique and turn ordinary reverse engineering methods to deal with the techniques useless.


### [The Go Reverse Engineering Tool Kit](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Reverse--Engineering](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Reverse--Engineering-gray)  
The Go Reverse Engineering Tool Kit (go-re.tk) is a new open source toolset for analyzing Go binaries. The tool is designed to extract as much metadata as possible from stripped binaries to aid both reverse engineering and malware analysis. Gore can, for example, detect the compiler version used, extract type information and recover function information, including source code line numbers for functions and source tree structure.

The core library is written in Go, but the tool kit includes C-bindings and a library implementation in Python. When using the C-bindings or the Python library, it is possible to write plugins for other analysis tools such as IDA Pro and Ghidra. The toolset also includes "redress", a command line tool to "re-dress" stripped Go binaries. It can both be used standalone to print out extracted information from the binary or as a radare2 plugin to reconstruct stripped symbols and type information.

The goal with the tool kit is to lower the bar to enter for anyone that wants to analyze programs written in Go.

### [Tracee: Linux Runtime Security and Forensics Using eBPF](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Reverse--Engineering](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Reverse--Engineering-gray)  
Tracee is a runtime security and forensics tool for Linux. It is composed of tracee-ebpf, which collects OS events, and tracee-rules, which is the runtime security detection engine.


Tracee-ebpf is capable of tracing all processes in the system or a group of processes according to some given filters. The set of events to trace can be selected by the user and include the following:


1. System calls
2. LSM hooks (security_file_open, security_bprm_check, cap_capable, ...)
3. Internal kernel functions (vfs_write, commit_creds, ...)
4. Special events and alerts (magic_write, mem_prot_alert, ...)


Other than tracing, Tracee-ebpf is also capable of capturing files written to disk or memory (e.g. "fileless" malwares), and extracting binaries that are dynamically loaded to an application's memory (e.g. when a malware uses a packer). Using these capabilities, it is possible to automatically collect forensic artifacts for later investigation.
Tracee-Rules, is a rule engine that helps you detect suspicious behavioral patterns in streams of events. It is primarily made to leverage events collected with Tracee-eBPF into a Runtime Security solution.
Tracee supports authoring rules in Golang or in Rego.

![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Reverse--Engineering](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Reverse--Engineering-gray)  
Tracee is a system tracing tool, focused on malware related behaviours.

Using eBPF technology of the Linux kernel, Tracee can trace selected system calls and internal kernel functions.
Other than tracing, Tracee is also capable of capturing files written to disk or memory (e.g. "fileless" malwares), and extracting binaries that are dynamically loaded to an application's memory (e.g. when a malware uses a packer). With these features, it is possible to quickly gain insights about the running processes that previously required the use of dynamic analysis tools and special knowledge.


### [Tracing Golang Windows API calls with gftrace](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Reverse--Engineering](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Reverse--Engineering-gray)  
gftrace is a Windows API tracing tool that abuses the way that the Golang runtime works to monitor all the API calls performed by Go applications. The project is a command line tool that only requires the user to specify what Windows functions to trace. Since the tool was designed to work with Go applications specifically it provides a very clean output based on the calls the main package performs and filters all the noise the Go runtime produces.

The tool is also very portable and reliable since it works with several (if not all) Go versions and only interacts with the Go runtime, without touching any Windows API call. gftrace can be very handy for fast malware triage and reverse engineering in general, specially when it comes to obfuscated, stripped and/or trojanized samples.


### [Unblob: A Firmware Extraction Framework](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Reverse--Engineering](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Reverse--Engineering-gray)  
One of the major challenges of embedded security analysis is the sound and safe extraction of arbitrary firmware.

Specialized tools that can extract information from those firmwares already exists, but we wanted something smarter that could identify both start offset of a specific chunk (e.g. filesystem, compression stream, archive) and end offset.

We stick to the format standard as much as possible when deriving these offsets, and we clearly define what we want out of identified chunks (e.g., not extracting meta-data to disk, padding removal).

This strategy helps us feed known valid data to extractors and precisely identify unidentified chunks, turning unknown unknowns into known unknowns.

Given the modular design of unblob and the ever expanding repository of supported formats, unblob could be used in areas outside of embedded security such as data recovery, memory forensics, or malware analysis.

unblob has been developed with the following objectives in mind:

* Accuracy - chunk start offsets are identified using battle tested rules, while end offsets are computed according to the format's standard without deviating from it. We minimize false positives as much as possible by validating header structures and discarding overflowing chunks.
* Security - unblob does not require elevated privileges to run. It's heavily tested and has been fuzz tested against a large corpus of files and firmware images. We rely on up-to-date third party dependencies that are locked to limit potential supply chain issues. We use safe extractors that we audited and fixed where required (e.g., path traversal in ubi_reader, path traversal in jefferson, integer overflow in Yara).
* Extensibility - unblob exposes an API that can be used to write custom format handlers and extractors in no time.
* Speed - we want unblob to be blazing fast, that's why we use multi-processing by default, make sure to write efficient code, use memory-mapped files, and use Hyperscan as high-performance matching library. Computation intensive functions are written in Rust and called from Python using specific bindings.

### [YARASAFE: Automatic Binary Function Similarity Checks with Yara](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Reverse--Engineering](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Reverse--Engineering-gray)  
YARASAFE is a new Yara module that automates the generation of rules containing binary similarity checks. Given a binary function, YARASAFE computes automatically its signature and includes it into a rule that will match any similar function.

This module rely on SAFE, a tool developed to create embedding vectors to represent binary functions. SAFE generates similarity-preserving embeddings: given two similar functions, their SAFE embeddings will be similar.

To create the embedding of a desired function YARASAFE includes an IDA Pro plugin: it sufficient to select the function in IDA and run the plugin to obtain its embedding.

YARASAFE can be used to create automatically yara rules for different purposes:

- Malware hunting
- Library function recognition
- Vulnerable function detection

Reversing a malicious PowerShell script can be a very tedious and time-consuming process, especially when the script is obfuscated. Z9 provides an efficient solution to this problem. It is a PowerShell script analyzer that can quickly deobfuscate the script and determine whether it is malicious or not. Z9 leverages several detection engines to make an informed decision.

* Obfuscation Detection
* Randomized String Detection
* URL Extractor
* Blacklist
* AI (Logistic Regression)
* Sandbox


### [chocoProxy: Aiding in the Reverse Engineering of Windows Applications' Network Traffic](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Reverse--Engineering](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Reverse--Engineering-gray)  
chocoProxy is a Windows tool intended to aid in reverse engineering Windows applications' network traffic. The proxy works by hooking the sending and receiving Windows APIs after being injected into a target process. The traffic can be modified to arbitrary values to observe the behaviour of an application when provided with unexpected input. The tool is meant to expedite the discovery and development of memory corruption exploits that occur in the implementation of complex and custom network protocols. chocoProxy takes away the necessity for exploit developers to reverse engineer a network protocol by utilizing the existing client/server functionality in the target.


### [uftrace: Dynamic Function Tracing Tool for C/C++/Rust programs](#)  
![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category-Reverse--Engineering](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category-Reverse--Engineering-gray)  
uftrace is a function tracing tool that helps in the analysis of C/C++/Rust programs. It hooks into the entry and exit of each function, recording timestamps as well as the function's arguments and return values. uftrace is capable of tracing both user and kernel functions, as well as library functions and system events providing an integrated execution flow in a single timeline.

Initially, uftrace only supported function tracing with compiler support. However, it now allows users to trace function calls without recompilation by analyzing instructions in each function prologue and dynamically and selectively patching those instructions.

Users can also write and run scripts for each function entry and exit using python/luajit APIs to create custom tools for their specific purposes.

uftrace offers various filters to reduce the amount of trace data and provides visualization using Chrome trace viewer and flame graphs, allowing for a big picture view of the execution flow.

uftrace was open sourced in 2016 and has been developed at https://github.com/namhyung/uftrace.
