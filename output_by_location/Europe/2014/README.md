Bluebox-ng is a GPL VoIP/UC vulnerability scanner written using Node.js powers. My two cents is to improve security practices in these environments and to make Node.js still more awesome. During this conference, the first stable version (v0.1.0) will be presented with some bugs fixed and these cool features:- Auto VoIP/UC penetration test- Report generation- Performance enhancements

Are you interested in the "Lights Off! The Darkness of the Smart Meters" talk that will be presented at Black Hat Europe? Then you should check this out! Since Arsenal brings the invaluable opportunity of allowing the attendees to get a closer look at researchers work, we want to show you the real stuff. We want you to be able to see, feel and touch the process of reversing we experienced, and show you the tools we used.There will be IDA, Logic Analysers, GDB, Arduino, blown hardware (literally!) and a lot of wires!

Memory forensics is the next step the forensic community has taken. With NAFT Online, you can learn memory forensics for Cisco IOS. Learn how to use the Network Appliance Forensic Toolkit with a real Cisco IOS router.

### [When You Dont Have 0days:  Client-side Exploitation for the Masses with BeEF](https://github.com/beefproject/beef/wiki/References)

A bag of fresh and juicy 0days is certainly something you would love to get as a Christmas present, but it would probably be just a dream you had one of those drunken nights.Hold on! Not all is lost! There is still hope for pwning targets without 0days.We will walk you through multiple real-life examples of client-side pwnage, from tricking the victim to take the bait, to achieving persistence on the compromised system.The examples will be highly practical and will demonstrate how you can do proper client-side exploitation effectively, simply by abusing existing functionalities of browsers, extensions, legacy features, etc.We'll delve into Chrome and Firefox extensions (automating various repetitive actions that you'll likely perform in your engagements), HTML applications (HTA), abusing User Interface expectations, (Open) Office macros and more. All the attacks are supposed to work on fully patched target software, with a bit of magic trickery as the secret ingredient.You might already know some of these exploitation vectors, but you might need a way to automate your attacks and tailor them based on the victim language, browser, and whatnot. Either way, if you like offensive security, this is for you.

### [ZAP](https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/wiki/ZapEvangelists/9e72f34d8bcb3b6940e6b28240a54063f6370e2d)

The Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP) is currently the most active open source web application security tool and competes effectively with commercial tools.While it is an ideal tool for people new to appsec, it also has many features specifically intended for advanced penetration testing.Zack will give a quick introduction to ZAP and then dive into the more advanced features, presenting some useful scripts as well as giving an overview of where its heading.
