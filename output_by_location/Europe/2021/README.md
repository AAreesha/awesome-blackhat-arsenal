🔗 **Link:** [RedHerd Framework](https://gist.github.com/Lysak/a0ca30a3e6732d39199b27c170a8cd28)  
📝 **Description:** RedHerd is a collaborative serverless framework for orchestrating a geographically distributed set of assets in order to simulate/conduct complex offensive cyberspace operations. The design and implementation of RedHerd perfectly fit the Open Systems Architecture design pattern, thanks to the adoption of both open standards and wide-spread open source software components.

The framework allows to seamlessly deploy a ready-to-use infrastructure that can be adopted for effective conduct, simulation and training purposes, by reliably joining a real-world cyberspace battlefield in which red and blue teams challenge each other to reach their goals. These elements lead to the Offensive Cyberspace Operations as a Service (OCOaaS) paradigm, which involves a complete software solution, locally set up, remotely deployed or Cloud-based, offering a layer of abstraction placed in front of the operative infrastructure and tools.

In this way, the operational actors have the opportunity to focus on the task execution, while ignoring all of the collateral activities. In addition, OCOaaS provides a flexible and quickly deployable solution to reduce costs. The RedHerd framework is a practical implementation of this model empowering the approach with strong orchestration capabilities and other additional features.

### Blue Team & Detection

<details><summary><strong>An Open Stack for Threat Hunting in Hybrid Cloud With Connected Observability</strong></summary>

![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category: Blue Team & Detection](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category:%20Blue%20Team%20&%20Detection-cyan) ![Xiaokui Shu](https://img.shields.io/badge/Xiaokui%20Shu-informational) ![Frederico Araujo](https://img.shields.io/badge/Frederico%20Araujo-informational) ![Teryl Taylor](https://img.shields.io/badge/Teryl%20Taylor-informational) ![Jiyong Jang](https://img.shields.io/badge/Jiyong%20Jang-informational)

🔗 **Link:** [An Open Stack for Threat Hunting in Hybrid Cloud With Connected Observability](#)  
📝 **Description:** We present a cloud-native threat hunting architecture built on open-source technologies. The security architecture integrates SysFlow and Kestrel to provide connected endpoint observability, edge analytics, and a cyber-reasoning stack that enables threat hunters to quickly and uniformly perform threat hunting and investigation across cloud and premise environments. This facilitates a new threat discovery methodology in which declarative hunting flows automate the search for behavioral attack patterns and indicators of compromise in telemetry data streams that are automatically tagged with attack TTPs. We show how these two open-source frameworks can deploy and scale natively on cloud environments to discover attacks and security breaches against cloud services and container infrastructures.

SysFlow is an open observability framework that lifts and normalizes the representation of system activities into a compact entity-relational format that records workload behaviors by connecting single-event and volumetric flow representations of process control flows, file interactions, and network communications. It drastically reduces data footprints over existing approaches and is particularly suitable for large scale cloud-wide monitoring and forensic investigation of sophisticated cyber-attacks that may not be discovered for long periods of time.

Kestrel is a threat hunting language for creating composable, reusable, and shareable hunt flows. It brings two key innovations to the security community: (i) a composable way of expressing hunting knowledge for threat hypothesis development and reasoning over entity-relational data abstractions, and (ii) an open-source language runtime to compute how to perform hunting steps and execute them in a distributed fashion at the local hunting site, remote data sources, and in the cloud.

We will demonstrate through live threat hunting scenarios how the two open-source projects can help create a powerful open platform for gaining operational awareness and alleviating key pain points in integrating security solutions into a "single-pane-of-glass" for effective and shareable threat hunting in the cloud.

🔗 **Link:** [In0ri](#)  
📝 **Description:** Have you ever wondered how many ways there are to detect a defacement attack?

- Based on hash
- Based on signature
- Differential comparison
- Machine learning

Well, quite a lot. Nowadays, machine learning have really developed, with increasing agility and accuracy, this is
a new approach in Cyber Security in general which can adapt to new attack techniques.

In this talk, we will be presenting In0ri - a defacement detection system utilizing image-classification convolutional neural network.
There's two ways to deploy and use In0ri:
- Running off crontab by periodically visiting the URL.
- Internal agent running off the web server

With the first method, we can directly check if a path has been defaced or not.
As a system administrator, we can use the second method to check a local website with an internal Agent.

In0ri the first source machine learning project to detect defacement attacks, we will show the process of installing, training and running In0ri. After that, we will show how it succeeds to get high quality of detecting the deface attacks by using deep learning.

🔗 **Link:** [Wireshark Forensics Toolkit](#)  
📝 **Description:** Wireshark is the most widely used network traffic analyzer. It is an important tool for both live traffic analysis & forensic analysis for forensic/malware analysts. Even though Wireshark provides incredibly powerful functionalities for protocol parsing & filtering, it does not provide any contextual information about network endpoints. For a typical analyst, who has to comb through GBs of PCAP files to identify malicious activity, it's like finding a needle in a haystack.

Wireshark Forensics Toolkit is a cross-platform Wireshark plugin that correlates network traffic data with threat intelligence, asset categorization & vulnerability data to speed up network forensic analysis. It does it by extending Wireshark native search filter functionality to allow filtering based on these additional contextual attributes. It works with both PCAP files and real-time traffic captures.

This toolkit provides the following functionality
- Loads malicious Indicators CSV exported from Threat Intelligence Platforms like MISP and associates it with each source/destination IP from network traffic
- Loads asset classification information based on IP-Range to Asset Type mapping which enables filtering incoming/outgoing traffic from a specific type of assets (e.g. filter for 'Database Server', 'Employee Laptop' etc)
- Loads exported vulnerability scan information exported from Qualys/Nessus map IP to CVEs.
- Extends native Wireshark filter functionality to allow filtering based severity, source, asset type & CVE information for each source or destination IP address in network logs

🔗 **Link:** [LazyCSRF: A More Useful CSRF PoC Generator on BurpSuite](#)  
📝 **Description:** Burp Suite is an intercepting HTTP Proxy, and it is the defacto tool for performing web application security testing. The feature of Burp Suite that I like the most is `Generate CSRF PoC`. However, the function to automatically determine the content of the request is broken, and it tries to generate PoCs using `form` even for PoCs that cannot be represented by `form`, such as JSON parameters and PUT requests. In addition, multibyte characters that can be displayed in Burp Suite itself are often garbled in the generated CSRF PoC. These were the motivations for creating LazyCSRF.


I have implemented a feature to solve them. It has the following features:
- Automatically switch to PoC using XMLHttpRequest
- In case the parameter is JSON
- In case the request is a PUT/PATCH/DELETE
- Support displaying multibyte characters (like Japanese)
- Generating CSRF PoC with Burp Suite Community Edition (of course, it also works in Professional Edition)

🔗 **Link:** [KICS: Keeping Infrastructure-as-Code Secure](https://github.com/oribendetcx)  
📝 **Description:** Infrastructure as Code (IaC) makes deploying cloud or container configurations scalable and faster. If you are launching a microservice into a Kubernetes cluster, or even building an entire AWS virtual infrastructure, IaC can automate the deployment. By building repeatable templates you can also ensure that deployments happen exactly as you design, every time.

However, errors in infrastructure configuration are now regarded as the second biggest cause of data breaches. There are many ways to give adversaries an advantage through security misconfigurations. Overly permissive storage volumes, unauthenticated database access, or ports left open to the internet have all been a cause of compromise. The solution? Treat your infrastructure code the same as your application code. During your build process, use tools to scan for infrastructure misconfigurations. When you find them raise alerts or even break the build. 

In this session, we will discuss common types of IaC misconfigurations, and demonstrate a free, open source security tool that developers can build into their pipelines to help protect infrastructure from compromise.

🔗 **Link:** [IDA2Obj: An Innovative Tool for Static Binary Instrumentation](#)  
📝 **Description:** As well known, object files are generated by c/c++ compiler or assembler from source code, and linked into an executable binary. But now, I can directly dump multiple object files just from one executable binary (exe, dll, ...) by using this tool. What's more amazing is that they can be linked again to a new binary, which is almost same as the old one !

It is designed mainly for SBI (Static Binary Instrumenation), to collect code coverage and integrate with popular fuzzing engines (AFL, honggfuzz, ...). Of course, it is faster than all of the DBI solutions.

🔗 **Link:** [LaiFu: A Modern Protocol Fuzzing Framework Based on Scapy](#)  
📝 **Description:** As a protocol tester, we often use scapy to interact with the protocol because it is able to craft or decode packets easily and it implements a wide number of protocols. However, the fuzz function supported by scapy can not fuzz protocols sufficiently and effectively. Testers often need to write additional fuzzing code based on other fuzzing frameworks such as Peach and Boofuzz.

According to the current situation, we design a protocol fuzzing tool named "LaiFu". LaiFu framework allows testers to use scapy to specify protocol formats directly. We designed the corresponding mutation algorithm according to the various field types of scapy's packet. Meanwhile, we also provide a tool to show the coverage of fuzzing target in real time. Testers only need to put each data packet as a node into the graph and then start the fuzzing test. Another advantage is that LaiFu makes many protocols already implemented by scapy to be fuzzable.

We are going to open source this tool to assist testers or developers to test their code and make protocol fuzzing easy and effective.

<details><summary><strong>The Vulnerability Complete Definition Library</strong></summary>

![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category: Red Teaming / AppSec](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category:%20Red%20Teaming%20/%20AppSec-red) ![Wish Wu](https://img.shields.io/badge/Wish%20Wu-informational)

🔗 **Link:** [The Vulnerability Complete Definition Library](https://github.com/mitre/cti/blob/master/pre-attack/pre-attack.json)  
📝 **Description:** More and more security researchers treat source code as a database and use code patterns to search or query potential vulnerabilities. At the Black Hat 2021 USA conference, the 360 ​​Alpha Lab team disclosed how to use code patterns to find 11 CVEs on Chrome, and developed a 0day exploit based on this. The code pattern is essentially a set of conditions for the code, and the code that satisfies certain conditions is very likely to have vulnerabilities. However, the industry does not seem to have a publicly available tool that can accurately describe or define the necessary and sufficient conditions for a specific vulnerability. Although CodeQL (https://securitylab.github.com/tools/codeql/) is already trying to convert the vulnerability described in natural language in Common Weakness Enumeration (https://cwe.mitre.org/) into query sentences , But most of its query conditions are sufficient and non-essential conditions to form a specific vulnerability, that is, it does not include all the circumstances that form this vulnerability. These query sentences avoid the conditions that CodeQL is difficult to process or describe to improve the success rate of the query. And I personally think that the grammatical rules of SQL often cannot intuitively describe the constraints of the code and the code running process, and a large number of built-in query processes also make the learning cost higher.

Therefore, I have developed a complete definition library for vulnerabilities and believe that this library has two main advantages. First, this library can describe constraints with syntax, design ideas, and keywords similar to the code used by developers, which makes this tool have a lower learning cost. Second, this library is designed to describe the necessary and sufficient conditions for the formation of vulnerabilities. The necessary and sufficient conditions here is used to describe all possible situations that form the vulnerabilities. We should not artificially modify the search conditions to make it easier for the algorithm of the search program to search for results, but should let the search algorithm determine by itself how to search can speed up the display of results.

This library is developed based on LLVM's AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) and the constraint solver STP (Simple Theorem Prover), and supports the description of constraints on objects such as control flow, data flow, value size, variable relations, variable types, variable names, etc. The library will also contain a batch of vulnerability definitions I wrote and a simple search algorithm. I will use a simple example to demonstrate how the algorithm finds a vulnerability in a specific situation based on the vulnerability definition. All source code will be hosted on github, you can download and study by yourself.

🔗 **Link:** [RAT Exploitation Tool for Social Networks](#)  
📝 **Description:** As we all know, many risks are involved with social networks such as impersonation, social-engineering, and data breach.

To demonstrate these attacks, we developed an innovative tool that can hijack and remotely control social network accounts by combining the powers of social engineering with malicious third party apps.

We built a private app store of phishing apps, with genres, that a bad actor can choose from to gain RAT control over victim accounts. To enable this, our tool manages oauth tokens within a single web console, allowing the hacker to exercise the functions of the victim accounts. To this end, we discuss other features and extensions of our tool, such as social engineering chat bots, crawlier bots, password crackers, and visualization tools for social network analytics.
