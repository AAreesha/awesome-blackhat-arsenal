                Adventure of Dynamic Link Library (aDLL) is a console tool for the analysis of binaries and focused on the automatic detection of possible DLL Hijacking cases in Windows systems. The purpose of the tool is to analyse every DLL that an executable will load in memory, anticipating the Windows DLL search order and identifying those DLLs that are missing from the expected directory. That may lead in the replacement of the legitimate DLL by a malicious one if the directory has misconfigured permissions.

                Nebula is a cloud C2 Framework, which at the moment offers reconnaissance, enumeration, exploitation, post exploitation on AWS, but still working to allow testing other Cloud Providers and DevOps Components.
It started as a project to unify all Cloud + DevOps Pentest and Security Techniques for a better assessment of the Infrastructures. It is build with modules for each provider and each functionality. As of April 2021, it only covers AWS, but is currently an ongoing project and hopefully will continue to grow to test GCP, Azure, Kubernetes, Docker, or automation engines like Ansible, Terraform, Chef, etc.

                The 'on-the-fly' tool intends to give the pentester an 'all-in-one' tool by deploying different functionalities applicable across the three domains of work: IoT, ICS & IT. The present work introduces a new framework in which enough functionalities will be provided to discover, evaluate, and audit technologies from the three mentioned domains.

                ![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category: Red Teaming](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category:%20Red%20Teaming-red) ![Mario D'Amico](https://img.shields.io/badge/Mario%20D'Amico-informational) ![Giovanni Pecoraro](https://img.shields.io/badge/Giovanni%20Pecoraro-informational) ![Simon Pietro Romano](https://img.shields.io/badge/Simon%20Pietro%20Romano-informational)

                RedHerd is a collaborative serverless framework for orchestrating a geographically distributed set of assets in order to simulate/conduct complex offensive cyberspace operations. The design and implementation of RedHerd perfectly fit the Open Systems Architecture design pattern, thanks to the adoption of both open standards and wide-spread open source software components.

The framework allows to seamlessly deploy a ready-to-use infrastructure that can be adopted for effective conduct, simulation and training purposes, by reliably joining a real-world cyberspace battlefield in which red and blue teams challenge each other to reach their goals. These elements lead to the Offensive Cyberspace Operations as a Service (OCOaaS) paradigm, which involves a complete software solution, locally set up, remotely deployed or Cloud-based, offering a layer of abstraction placed in front of the operative infrastructure and tools.

In this way, the operational actors have the opportunity to focus on the task execution, while ignoring all of the collateral activities. In addition, OCOaaS provides a flexible and quickly deployable solution to reduce costs. The RedHerd framework is a practical implementation of this model empowering the approach with strong orchestration capabilities and other additional features.

You can install it via Docker ( it includes an Angular front end with a symfony API )
There is also a python client for the bearded ones.
The graphical interface allows you to add your scope and vulnerabilities and exchange information with your hacker partners in a Quick and easy way (also possible to generate report).

                Because preventing vulnerability is less costly than redeveloping the complete application, infosec education and training become more and more actual. As a result, developers can greatly reduce the risk and expense from cyber attacks in the future by creating secure code. In addition, training the team based on the security assessment results to correct actual errors provides ongoing protection for existing and future products.

Since studying is impossible without a practical part, providing hands-on lab training for developing teams is a necessary step.
AppsecStudy - an open-source platform for seminars, training, and organizing courses for practical information security for developers and IT specialists. This tool has all the built-in basic requirements needed for organizing normal and productive training.

                Infrastructure as Code (IaC)â€¯makes deploying cloud or container configurations scalable and faster. If you are launching a microservice into a Kubernetes cluster, or even building an entire AWS virtual infrastructure, IaC can automate the deployment. By building repeatable templates you can also ensure that deployments happen exactly as you design, every time.

However, errors in infrastructure configuration are now regarded as the second biggest cause of data breaches. There are many ways to give adversaries an advantage through security misconfigurations. Overly permissive storage volumes, unauthenticated database access, or ports left open to the internet have all been a cause of compromise. The solution? Treat your infrastructure code the same as your application code. During your build process, use tools to scan for infrastructure misconfigurations. When you find them raise alerts or even break the build.â€¯

In this session, we will discuss common types of IaC misconfigurations, and demonstrate a free, open source security tool that developers can build into their pipelines to help protect infrastructure from compromise.

<details><summary><strong>[The Vulnerability Complete Definition Library](https://github.com/mitre/cti/blob/master/pre-attack/pre-attack.json)</strong></summary>

                ![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category: Red Teaming / AppSec](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category:%20Red%20Teaming%20/%20AppSec-red) ![Wish Wu](https://img.shields.io/badge/Wish%20Wu-informational)

                More and more security researchers treat source code as a database and use code patterns to search or query potential vulnerabilities. At the Black Hat 2021 USA conference, the 360 â€‹â€‹Alpha Lab team disclosed how to use code patterns to find 11 CVEs on Chrome, and developed a 0day exploit based on this. The code pattern is essentially a set of conditions for the code, and the code that satisfies certain conditions is very likely to have vulnerabilities. However, the industry does not seem to have a publicly available tool that can accurately describe or define the necessary and sufficient conditions for a specific vulnerability. Although CodeQL (https://securitylab.github.com/tools/codeql/) is already trying to convert the vulnerability described in natural language in Common Weakness Enumeration (https://cwe.mitre.org/) into query sentences , But most of its query conditions are sufficient and non-essential conditions to form a specific vulnerability, that is, it does not include all the circumstances that form this vulnerability. These query sentences avoid the conditions that CodeQL is difficult to process or describe to improve the success rate of the query. And I personally think that the grammatical rules of SQL often cannot intuitively describe the constraints of the code and the code running process, and a large number of built-in query processes also make the learning cost higher.

Therefore, I have developed a complete definition library for vulnerabilities and believe that this library has two main advantages. First, this library can describe constraints with syntax, design ideas, and keywords similar to the code used by developers, which makes this tool have a lower learning cost. Second, this library is designed to describe the necessary and sufficient conditions for the formation of vulnerabilities. The necessary and sufficient conditions here is used to describe all possible situations that form the vulnerabilities. We should not artificially modify the search conditions to make it easier for the algorithm of the search program to search for results, but should let the search algorithm determine by itself how to search can speed up the display of results.

This library is developed based on LLVM's AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) and the constraint solver STP (Simple Theorem Prover), and supports the description of constraints on objects such as control flow, data flow, value size, variable relations, variable types, variable names, etc. The library will also contain a batch of vulnerability definitions I wrote and a simple search algorithm. I will use a simple example to demonstrate how the algorithm finds a vulnerability in a specific situation based on the vulnerability definition. All source code will be hosted on github, you can download and study by yourself.
