                The Android Device Testing Framework ("dtf") project started back in 2014 as a collection of scripts and utilities that aimed to help individuals answer the question: "Where are the vulnerabilities on this mobile device?"  Since then, dtf has grown into a robust and extensive data collection and analysis framework with over 30 modules that allow testers to obtain information from their Android device, process this information into databases, and then start searching for vulnerabilities (all without requiring root privileges).  These modules help you focus on changes made to AOSP components such as applications, frameworks, system services, as well as lower-level components such as binaries, libraries, and device drivers.  In addition, you'll be able to analyze new functionality implemented by the OEMs and other parties to find vulnerabilities.

                Ever wondered how different attacking and exploiting a Mobile application would be, from a traditional web application? Gone are the days when knowledge of just SQL Injection or XSS could help you land a lucrative high-paying infoSec job.Watch as Dinesh walks you through his new and shiny updated custom application - "Android-InsecureBank" and some other source code review tools, to help you understand some known and some not so known Android Security bugs and ways to exploit them.This presentation will cover Mobile Application Security attacks that will get n00bs as well as 31337 attendees started on the path of Mobile Application Penetration testing.Some of the vulnerabilities in the Android InsecureBank application that will be discussed (but not limited to) are:- Flawed Broadcast Receivers- Root Detection and Bypass- Local Encryption issues- Vulnerable Activity Components- Insecure Content Provider access- Insecure Webview implementation- Weak Cryptography implementation- Application Patching- Sensitive Information in MemoryExpect to see a lot of demos, tools, hacking and have lots of fun.

<details><summary><strong>[Commix: Detecting And Exploiting Command Injection Flaws](https://github.com/commixproject/commix)</strong></summary>

                Command injections are prevalent to any application independently of its operating system that hosts the application or the programming language that the application itself is developed.The impact of command injection attacks ranges from loss of data confidentiality and integrity to unauthorized remote access to the system that hosts the vulnerable application. A prime example of a real, infamous command injection vulnerability that clearly depicts the threats of this type of code injection was the recently discovered Shellshock bug.Despite the prevalence and the high impact of the command injection attacks, little attention has been given by the research community to this type of code injection. In particular, we have observed that although there are many software tools to detect and exploit other types of code injections such as SQL injections or Cross Site Scripting, to the best of our knowledge there is no dedicated and specialized software application that detects and exploits automatically command injection attacks. This paper attempts to fill this gap by proposing an open source tool that automates the process of detecting and exploiting command injection flaws on web applications, named as commix, (COMMand Injection  eXploitation).This tool supports a plethora of functionalities, in order to cover several exploitation scenarios. Moreover, Commix is capable ofdetecting, with high success rate, whether a web application is vulnerable to command injection attacks. Finally, during the evaluation of the tool we have detected several 0-day vulnerabilities in applications.Overall, the contributions of this work are: a) We provide a comprehensive analysis and categorization of command injection attacks; b) We present and analyze our open source tool that automates the process of detecting and exploiting command injection vulnerabilities; c) We will reveal(during presentation) several 0-day command injection vulnerabilities that Commix detected on various web based applications from home services (embedded devices) to web servers.

                It is not uncommon for people who are not experts in security to reuse credentials on different websites; even security savvy people reuse credentials all the time. For this reason "credmap: the Credential Mapper" was created, to bring awareness to the dangers of credential reuse. Credmap takes a user and password as input and it attempts to login on a variety of known websites to test if the user has reused credentials on any of these. New websites can be easily added with simple knowledge of Python.Credmap is also capable of searching in public credential dumps of compromised websites (e.g. r0ckyou, AM, Adobe, etc.) and collecting the user's password from there to then test with on other websites. Credmap was written purely in Python and is open-source and available on GitHub.

                DVCS-Ripper will rip web accessible (distributed) version control systems ranging from Subversion and git to Mercurial and Bazaar. It can rip repositories even when directory browsing is turned off. The new release adds support for ripping packed refs in git and it speeds up git ripping drastically. Currently it is the fastest and most feature packed source code ripper tool.

                Jack is a novel web based tool to assist in the identification and illustration of abusing web resources in terms of ClickJacking. Jack allows implementers to identify if certain online resources are vulnerable to ClickJacking and also allows implementers to generate a PoC to harvest submitted user credentials to illustrate the affect of the vulnerability. Jack also allows implementers to generate a local instance of the PoC site and deploy it a HTTP container such as Apache.

                IntelMQ is a solution for collecting and processing security feeds, pastebins, and tweets using a message queue protocol. It's a community driven initiative called IHAP (Incident Handling Automation Project) which was conceptually designed by European CERTs during several InfoSec events. Its main goal is to give to incident responders an easy way to collect & process threat intelligence thus improving the incident handling processes of CERTs.

                The Volatility Bot-Excavator: effective automation for executable file extraction. Made by and for security researchers.Part of the work security researchers have to go through when they have to study new malware or wish to analyse suspicious executables, is to extract the binary file and all the different satellite injections and strings decrypted during the malware's execution. This initial process is mostly manual, which can make it long and incomprehensive.Enter the Volatility Bot-Excavator. This is a tool developed by and for malware researchers, leveraging the Volatility Framework. This new automation tool cuts out all the guesswork and manual extraction from the binary extraction phase. Not only does it automatically extract the executable (exe), but it also fetches all new processes created in memory, code injections, strings, IP addresses and so on.Beyond the obvious value of having a complete extraction automated and produced in under one minute, the Bot-Excavator is highly effective against a large variety of malware codes and their respective load techniques. It can take on complex malware including banking trojans such as ZeuS, Cridex, and Dyre, just as easily as it extracts from simpler downloaders of the like of Upatre, Pony or even from targeted malware like Havex.After the Bot-Excavator finishes the extraction, it can further automate repair or prepare the extracted elements for the next step in analysis. For example, it can the Portable Executable (PE) header, prepare for static analysis via tools like IDA, go to a YARA scan, etc.
