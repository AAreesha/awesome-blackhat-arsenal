                Ensuring cybersecurity in the automotive sector is more crucial than ever, especially with the rising intricacies and susceptibilities of vehicle-connected systems. The ISO/SAE 21434 standard serves as a beacon in this endeavor. However, compliance with this standard reveals discernible information disparities across its V-model phases: Concept & Design, Implementation, and Verification & Validation. Addressing these gaps is paramount for cohesive vehicle cybersecurity.

To tackle these hurdles, we introduce the "Attack Knowledge Base for Automotive." Inspired and aligned with the ATT&CK framework, this tool aids in seamless compliance with the ISO/SAE 21434 standard. We will demonstrate its efficacy in delivering a thorough and objective outcome during Threat Analysis and Risk Assessment (TARA). Moreover, it bridges information lacunas across the lifecycle, enabling the red team to synergize insights from earlier stages with our Attack Knowledge Base, ensuring holistic automotive cybersecurity.

<details><summary><strong>[MetaHub: Automating Ownership, Context and Impact Assessments in Security Findings](https://github.com/gabrielsoltz/metahub)</strong></summary>

                ![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category: Red Teaming / AppSec](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category:%20Red%20Teaming%20/%20AppSec-red) ![Gabriel Alejandro Soltz](https://img.shields.io/badge/Gabriel%20Alejandro%20Soltz-informational)

                Security findings from automated sources such as CSPMs, software vulnerability scanners, or compliance scanners often overwhelm security teams with excessive, generic, context-less information. You may have heard countless times that context in security is key, so why don't these tools provide you with more of it? Simply put, they were not designed to do so.

This shortcoming means that determining ownership and impact can be time-consuming, leading to critical vulnerabilities going unnoticed, and causing unnecessary noise or friction between security teams and other departments.

My proposed demo introduces MetaHub, a tool designed to address these issues by automating the three essential stages of security finding assessment: owner determination, contextualization, and impact definition. Leveraging metadata through MetaChecks, MetaTags, MetaTrails, and MetaAccount, MetaHub provides a detailed, context-aware assessment of each finding.

By integrating MetaHub, teams can significantly reduce false positives, streamline the detection and resolution of security findings, and strategically tailor their scanner selection to minimize unnecessary noise. The ability to concentrate on meaningful, high-impact issues will be the primary focus of the demo.

MetaHub relies on the ASFF format for ingesting security findings and can consume data from AWS Security Hub or any ASFF-supported scanner like Prowler, ElectricEye, or Inspector. This compatibility means you can continue using the scanners you already rely on but add what's missing to those findings: Ownership, Context, and Impact.

MetaHub also generates powerful visual reports and is designed for use as a CLI tool or within automated workflows, such as AWS Security Hub custom actions or AWS Lambda functions.

The automation of context, ownership, and impact is not commonly addressed by open-source tools; MetaHub introduces a solution to this problem that aims to be agnostic to the source scanner.

                go-exploit is an exploit development framework for Go. The framework helps exploit developers create small, self-contained, portable, and consistent exploits.

Many proof-of-concept exploits rely on interpreted languages with complicated packaging systems. They implement wildly differing user interfaces, and have limited ability to be executed within a target network. Some exploits are integrated into massive frameworks that are burdened by years of features and dependencies which overwhelm developers and hinder the attacker's ability to deploy the exploits from unconventional locations.

To overcome these challenges, go-exploit offers a lightweight framework with minimal dependencies, written in Go—a language renowned for its portability and cross-compilation capabilities. The framework strikes a balance between simplicity for rapid proof-of-concept development and the inclusion of sophisticated built-in features for operational use.

                Memory corruption vulnerabilities are becoming less common than their more reliable command execution counterparts. In the last year, two-thirds of the exploits Metasploit released resulted in OS command execution in some way as opposed to direct execution of injected code. Metasploit has made multiple improvements to its command payloads to keep pace with these exploitation trends. These updates make it easier for module authors to deliver a wider variety of second-stage payloads and grant users greater flexibility in selecting their delivery mechanism.

This arsenal demonstration will cover the latest improvements to Metasploits payloads, command stagers, and Meterpreter. The audience will see how these payloads can be used, customized and how the exploit development process has improved.

                Honeypots are now considered a well-studied cyber-deception mechanism that can assist in defending networks as well as identifying new attack trends. However, recent research has shown that honeypots may also be vulnerable to attacks; especially fingerprinting identification ones. Moreover, many open-source honeypots lack an external security analysis and are often deployed with their default settings.

We present honeyscanner, an open-source vulnerability analyzer for honeypots. It is designed to automatically attack a given honeypot, to determine if the honeypot is vulnerable to specific types of cyber-attacks. The analyzer uses a variety of attacks, ranging from identifying vulnerable software libraries to DoS, and fuzzing attacks. In the end, an evaluation report is provided to the honeypot administrator, including advice on how to enhance the security of the honeypot.

                For the last 7 years we developed Slips, a behavioral-based intrusion prevention system, and the first free-software network IDS using machine learning. Slips profiles the behavior of IP addresses and performs detections inside each time window in order to also *unblock* IPs. Slips has more than 20 modules that detect a range of attacks both to and from the protected device. It is an network EDR with the capability to also protect small networks.

Slips consumes multiple packets and flows, exporting data to SIEMs. More importantly, Slips is the first IDS to automatically create a local P2P network of sensors, where instances share detections following a trust model resilient to adversaries..

Slips works in several directionality modes. The user can choose to detect attacks coming *to* or going *from* these profiles, or both. This makes it easy to protect your network but also to focus on infected computers inside your network, which is a novel technique.

Among its modules, Slips includes the download/manage of external Threat Intelligence feed (including our laboratory's own TI feed), whois/asn/geocountry enrichment, a LSTM neural net for malicious behavior detection, port scanning detection (vertical and horizontal) on flows, long connection detection, etc. The decisions to block profiles or not are based on ensembling
algorithms. The P2P module connects to other Slips to share detection alerts.

Slips can read packets from the network, pcap, Suricata, Zeek, Argus and Nfdump, and can output alerts files and summaries. Having Zeek as a base tool, Slips can correctly build a sorted timeline of flows combining all Zeek logs. Slips can send alerts using the STIX/TAXII protocol.

Slips web interface allows to clearly see the detections and behaviors, including threat inteligence enhancements. The interface can show multiple Slips runs, summarize whois/asn/geocountry information and much more.

                SSH to Any Device with No Ports Open
Make your devices reachable while eliminating network attack surfaces & reducing administrative overhead.

Atsign's patent pending core technology is engineered to deliver the following benefits:
Addressability
Atsign's core technology uses identifiers which replace the need to manage IP addresses. If you remember the atSign (Atsign's version of an address), you can look up the IP address and port in the atDirectory which manages this information for you.
Reachability
‍Atsign's core technology provides each device with its own microserver which makes it reachable from anywhere on the internet.
No open ports (no network attack surface) on the device
Connections are always made from the device to the microserver, meaning that no ports ever need to be opened on devices using this technology.
End-to-end encrypted
Information is automatically encrypted on the edge devices before it is sent over Atsign's control plane.
Zero Trust
Atsign's technology is designed such that cryptographic keys are only stored at the edge device. No third party or intermediary ever possesses the decryption keys which are required to access the information. You don't need to trust any of the microservers, because they never see information in the clear.
In other words, sending information using Atsign's control plane requires no open ports and is fully edge-to-edge encrypted, all without needing to know the IP address of the device!

                In the world of Cyber Security and especially malware research and reverse engineering, we often put ourselves and our PCs at constant risk, and a common method to mitigate this is by using a Virtual Machine and while this method is great for keeping our PCs safe, it does not address a larger issue - our network.

This is true especially now, with the rise in popularity of remote and hybrid work where we have to research on networks that lack corporate-level protection solutions like our homes!

SafeNet is a solution to keep our research labs and dirty virtual machines connected to the internet, all while segregating them from our local network and keeping it safe, ensuring that we can continue researching while staying as safe as possible.

                gftrace is a Windows API tracing tool that abuses the way that the Golang runtime works to monitor all the API calls performed by Go applications. The project is a command line tool that only requires the user to specify what Windows functions to trace. Since the tool was designed to work with Go applications specifically it provides a very clean output based on the calls the main package performs and filters all the noise the Go runtime produces.

The tool is also very portable and reliable since it works with several (if not all) Go versions and only interacts with the Go runtime, without touching any Windows API call. gftrace can be very handy for fast malware triage and reverse engineering in general, specially when it comes to obfuscated, stripped and/or trojanized samples.
