                The Android Device Testing Framework ("dtf") is a data collection and analysis framework to help individuals answer the question: "Where are the vulnerabilities on this mobile device?"  Dtf provides a modular approach and built-in APIs that allows testers to quickly create scripts to interact with their Android devices.  The default download of dtf comes with multiple modules that allow testers to obtain information from their Android device, process this information into databases, and then start searching for vulnerabilities (all without requiring root privileges).  These modules help you focus on changes made to AOSP components such as applications, frameworks, system services, as well as lower-level components such as binaries, libraries, and device drivers.  In addition, youâll be able to analyze new functionality implemented by the OEMs and other parties to find vulnerabilities.

                As smartphones enter the workplace, sharing the network and accessing sensitive data, it is crucial to be able to assess the security posture of these devices in much the same way we perform penetration tests on workstations and servers. However, smartphones have unique attack vectors that are not currently covered by available industry tools. The smartphone penetration testing framework, the result of a DARPA Cyber Fast Track project, aims to provide an open source toolkit that addresses the many facets of assessing the security posture of these devices. We will look at the functionality of the framework including information gathering, exploitation, social engineering, and post exploitation through both a traditional IP network and through the mobile modem, showing how this framework can be leveraged by security teams and penetration testers to gain an understanding of the security posture of the smartphones in an organization. SPF can be used as a pivot to gain access to an internal network, gaining access to additional vulnerabilities. SPF can be used to bypass filtering, using SMS to control an exploited internal system. Demonstrations of SPF functionality will be shown.

                A world without malware is ideal but unlikely. Many of us would prefer *not* to install another layer of protection on our already-resource-constrained handheld mobile device. Alternatively, Android malware detection sans anti-virus installation has become a reality. Learn about how itâs possible to detect mobile malware using simple text messages with ZitMo NoM. ZeuS in the Mobile, known as ZitMo, is infamous for intercepting SMS transmissions then redirecting them to a Command and Control in order steal banking and personal information. Research with SMS transmissions directed at mobile malware has resulted in the ability to detect ZitMoâs presence without anti-virus applications installed. Turning cyber criminals' tools against them makes this even more of a rewarding endeavor. We are looking for malware researchers to contribute to the continued development of this open tool. The presentation will include the research, the infrastructure, and a demonstration of ZitMo NoM. Live malware will be used during this presentation, assuming we get it to behave.

                Since its adoption as the standard binary file format for *nix systems, a variety of vulnerabilities in ELF parsers have been found and exploited in OS kernels, debuggers, libraries, etc. Most of these flaws have been found manually through code review and binary modification. Nowadays, 15 years later, common programming mistakes are still being implemented in many ELF parsers that are being released these days very often, either as debuggers, reverse engineering tools, AV analyzers, plugins or as malware (yes, malware has parsers too). Here's where ELF file format fuzzing comes into the game to help you to identify these bugs in an automated fashion.

                Detecting malware is difficult, and analyzing a detected piece of malware's behavior is even more difficult. Techniques for analysis generally fall into one of three camps: static analysis of the malicious binary on disk, dynamic analysis as the binary executes, or a hybrid approach using a snapshot of physical RAM taken as the malware executes. As the result of our DARPA Cyber Fast Track (CFT) funded research, we extend this third approach. We present a novel technique for leveraging information including multiple snapshots of physical RAM for malware detection and analysis. The technique is implemented as DAMM, a tool for differential analysis of malware in memory. DAMM functions by leveraging multiple snapshots of RAM, domain knowledge about known-benign in-memory artifacts, and indicators of malicious activity to present to the user a powerful view of malicious execution in memory.

                Attackers have all the fun. With slick, integrated, real-time, open suites like metasploit, armitage, SET, and lair they quickly seek out targets, share exploits, gain footholds, and usually win.

                Last year, we delivered the definitive guide for pen-testers on hacking low frequency (LF - 125KHz) RFID badge systems to gain unauthorized access to buildings and other secure areas.  In this second installment, weâre raising the stakes, peeling back the onion even further, and directly confronting the RFID elephant in the room â hacking High Frequency (HF - 13.56 MHz) and Ultra-High Frequency (UHF â 840-960 MHz).

                PowerSploit is a popular collection of Microsoft PowerShell modules that can be used to aid reverse engineers, forensic analysts, and penetration testers during all phases of an assessment. Come see how PowerShell can be leveraged to accomplish things that would otherwise be impossible such as, loading binaries directly into memory. Joseph Bialek and Chris Campbell will demonstrate how to utilize PowerSploit to bypass security products through all phases of a mock penetration test which includes enumeration, exploitation, privilege-escalation, credential theft, and pivoting to other hosts. They will share tips and tricks to leverage PowerShell in your own tools and highlight the new privilege escalation module being introduced at ToolsWatch.

                In 2008 we released reDuh (http://research.sensepost.com/tools/web/reduh), a network tunnelling tool that allowed port forwarding via a web-shell and HTTP/S to backend services. reDuh has since become part of any attackers standard toolkit, featuring in several books and notoriously described as "insidious" by HBGary in their leaked e-mails.

                The Veil-Framework is an open source project that aims to bridge the gap between pen-testing and red team toolsets. It began with Veil-Evasion, a tool to generate AV-evading payload executables, expanded into payload delivery with the release of Veil-Catapult, and branched into Powershell functionality with the release of Veil-PowerView for domain situational awareness. This Arsenal presentation will cover the inner workings of all of these tools, and demonstrate various use cases where the Veil-Framework can help facilitate engagements.

                Morning Catch is a Virtual Machine environment, similar to Metasploitable, to demonstrate and teach about targeted client-side attacks. Morning Catch is a fictitious seafood company with a website, self-contained email infrastructure to receive phishing emails, and two desktop environments. One desktop environment is a vulnerable Linux client-side attack surface. The other desktop environment is a vulnerable Windows client-side attack surface. Yes, you'll get to attack a Windows software target and use Windows payloads against this virtual environment. This Arsenal session will demonstrate some of the things you can do with the Morning Catch environment.

                Snoopy is a distributed tracking, data interception, and profiling framework. The software can run on small, cost-effective hardware (BeagleBone, RaspberryPi) and be deployed over a large area (we call these 'drones'). Each Snoopy drone passively or actively collects information on people who walk past from the array of wireless (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, etc.) devices that they carry on their person. This information is synchronized to a central server where we can visually explore it with tools like Maltego.

                With the PRISM scandal, we began to question whether Microsoft, Google, Apple, and Facebook were the only companies working with governments to spy on the behavior of its citizens. Will WhatsApp be one of these companies? Does WhatsApp store its user conversations? These sort of things make us think that users are defenseless and have no current measures to ensure the privacy of content shared on these platforms.
