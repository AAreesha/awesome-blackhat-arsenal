                The AirTag IoT device is a tracking tool developed by Apple and designed to help people find misplaced objects. However, even when Apple states that AirTag technology is solely used for tracking items, a growing number of malicious individuals are taking advantage for the simplicity to install it and set up to track unaware targets, in other words, people.

Amini is a specialized open-source hardware project to scan, detect, spoof, and play a sound for AirTag devices. This project is part of "Spy-wear: Misuse of Apple AirTags" research where we analyzed a privacy concern about AirTag misuse for tracking capabilities. It was designed to be implemented with Arduino environment, for flexible designs, and to be used in any Arduino-supported devices with BLE capabilities.

                As security professionals, almost every action we take comes down to making a risk-based decision. Web application vulnerabilities, malware infections, physical vulnerabilities, and much more all boils down to some combination of the likelihood of an event happening and the impact it will have. Risk management is a relatively simple concept to grasp, but the place where many practitioners fall down is in the tool set. The lucky security professionals work for companies who can afford expensive GRC tools to aide in managing risk. The unlucky majority out there usually end up spending countless hours managing risk via spreadsheets. It's cumbersome, time consuming, and just plain sucks. After starting a Risk Management program from scratch at a $1B/year company, Josh Sokol ran into these same barriers and where budget wouldn't let him go down the GRC route, he finally decided to do something about it. SimpleRisk is a simple and free tool to perform organizational Governance, Risk Management, and Compliance activities. Based entirely on open source technologies and sporting a Mozilla Public License 2.0, a SimpleRisk instance can be stood up in minutes and instantly provides the security professional with the ability to manage control frameworks, policies, and exceptions, facilitate audits, and perform risk prioritization and mitigation activities. It is highly configurable and includes dynamic reporting and the ability to tweak risk formulas on the fly. It is under active development with new features being added all the time. SimpleRisk is Enterprise Risk Management simplified.

                Compromising an organization's cloud infrastructure is like sitting on a gold mine for attackers. And sometimes, a simple misconfiguration or a vulnerability in web applications, is all an attacker needs to compromise the entire infrastructure. Since the cloud is relatively new, many developers are not fully aware of the threatscape and they end up deploying a vulnerable cloud infrastructure. When it comes to web application pentesting on traditional infrastructure, deliberately vulnerable applications such as DVWA and bWAPP have helped the infosec community in understanding the popular web attack vectors. However, at this point in time, we do not have a similar framework for the cloud environment.

In this talk, we will be introducing AWSGoat, a vulnerable by design infrastructure on AWS featuring the latest released OWASP Top 10 web application security risks (2021) and other misconfiguration based on services such as IAM, S3, API Gateway, Lambda, EC2, and ECS. AWSGoat mimics real-world infrastructure but with added vulnerabilities. The idea behind AWSGoat is to provide security enthusiasts and pen-testers with an easy to deploy/destroy vulnerable infrastructure where they can learn how to enumerate cloud applications, identify vulnerabilities, and chain various attacks to compromise the AWS account. The deployment scripts will be open-source and made available after the talk.

                Microsoft Azure cloud has become the second-largest vendor by market share in the cloud infrastructure providers (as per multiple reports), just behind AWS. There are numerous tools and vulnerable applications available for AWS for the security professional to perform attack/defense practices, but it is not the case with Azure. There are far fewer options available to the community. AzureGoat is our attempt to shorten this gap.

In this talk, we will be introducing AzureGoat, a vulnerable by design infrastructure on the Azure cloud environment. AzureGoat will allow a user to do the following:

- Explore a vulnerable infrastructure hosted on an Azure account
- Exploring different ways to get a foothold into the environment, e.g., vulnerable web app, exposed endpoint, attached MSI
- Learn and practice different attacks by leveraging misconfigured Azure components like Virtual Machines, Storage Accounts, App Services, Databases, etc.
- Abusing Azure AD roles and permissions
- Auditing and fixing misconfiguration in IaC
- Redeploying the fixed/patched infrastructure

The user will be able to deploy AzureGoat on their Azure account using a pre-created Docker image and scripts. Once deployed, the AzureGoat can be used for target practice and be conveniently deleted later.

All the code and deployment scripts will be made open-source after the talk.

<details><summary><strong>[Badrats: Initial Access Made Easy](https://gist.github.com/GMMan/4fa8860dc60460828217?permalink_comment_id=1451134)</strong></summary>

                Remote Access Trojans (RATs) are one of the defining tradecraft for identifying an Advanced Persistent Threat. The reason being is that APTs typically leverage custom toolkits for gaining initial access, so they do not risk burning full-featured implants. Badrats takes characteristics from APT Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) and implements them into a custom Command and Control (C2) tool with a focus on initial access and implant flexibility. The key goal is to emulate that modern threat actors avoid loading fully-featured implants unless required, instead opting to use a smaller staged implant.

Badrats implants are written in various languages, each with a similar yet limited feature set. The implants are designed to be small for antivirus evasion and provides multiple methods of loading additional tools, such as shellcode, .NET assemblies, PowerShell, and shell commands on a compromised host. One of the most advanced TTPs that Badrats supports is peer-to-peer communications over SMB to allow implants to communicate through other compromised hosts.

                PyRDP is a Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) monster-in-the-middle (MITM) tool and library useful in intrusion testing, and protocol and malware research. Its out-of-the-box offensive capabilities can be divided in three broad categories: client-side, MITM-side and server-side. On the client-side, PyRDP can actively steal any clipboard activity, crawl mapped drives and collect all keystrokes. On the MITM-side PyRDP records everything on the wire in several formats (logs, JSON events), captures the user's hashes on-the-fly to enable hash cracking, it also allows an attacker to take control of an active session and performs a pixel perfect recording of the RDP screen. On the server-side, on-logon PowerShell or command injection can be performed when a legitimate client connects.

As a research tool, PyRDP can be used as part of a fully interactive honeypot. It can be placed in front of a Windows RDP server to intercept malicious sessions. It can replace the credentials provided in the connection sequence with working credentials to accelerate compromise and malicious behavior collection. It also saves a visual and textual recording of each RDP session, which is useful for investigation or to generate IOCs. Additionally, PyRDP saves a copy of the files that are transferred via the drive redirection feature, allowing it to collect malicious payloads.

This year we have implemented NetNTLMv2 hash capturing for NLA sessions which enables pentesters and offensive researchers to crack hashes in order to retrieve passwords used during the user's connection.

                Azure AD registered and joined devices use a device certificate and transport key to sign and decrypt communication between the device and Azure AD. The most important part of this is Primary Refresh Token (PRT) and an associated session key. The session key can be decrypted with the transport key and subsequent communication with the session key.
SecureworksÂ® Primary Refresh Token (PRT) viewer automates the decryption process. Using the transport key exported from the target computer, it automatically decrypts the session key from the PRT authentication request response. With the decrypted session key, it decrypts subsequent requests/responses decrypted with the session key.
The tool enables monitoring the traffic between the target device and Azure AD in plaintext, allowing extracting keys, access tokens, and other secrets.
The tool is available as Burp Suite Extender and Fiddler Add-On.

                SharpSCCM is an open-source C# utility for interacting with SCCM, inspired by the PowerSCCM project by @harmj0y, @jaredcatkinson, @enigma0x3, and @mattifestation. This tool can be used to demonstrate the impact of configuring SCCM without the recommended security settings, which can be found here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/configmgr/core/clients/deploy/plan/security-and-privacy-for-clients

Currently, SharpSCCM supports the NTLMv2 coercion attack techniques noted in this post (https://posts.specterops.io/coercing-ntlm-authentication-from-sccm-e6e23ea8260a), as well as the attack techniques noted in this post (https://enigma0x3.net/2016/02/29/offensive-operations-with-powersccm/), which have been modified to coerce NTLMv2 authentication rather than running PowerShell on the target. SharpSCCM can also be used to dump information about the SCCM environment from a client, including the plaintext credentials for Network Access Accounts.

Research is ongoing to add SharpSCCM features to:
- pull and decrypt Network Access Account credentials from SCCM servers using a low-privileged account on any client machine
- execute actions in SCCM environments that require PKI certificates to secure client/server communications
- escalate privileges from local administrator on site servers to SCCM Full Administrator

                SMBeagle is an SMB file share auditing and enumeration tool that rapidly hunts out file shares and inventories their contents. Built from a desire to find poorly protected files, SMBeagle casts the spotlight on files vulnerable to ransomware, watering hole attacks and which may contain sensitive credentials.

SMBeagle hunts out all files it can see in the network and reports if the file can be read and/or written. All these findings are streamed out to either a CSV file or an elasticsearch host?

Businesses of all sizes often have file shares with awful file permissions.

Large businesses have sprawling file shares and its common to find sensitive data with misconfigured permissions and small businesses often have a small NAS in the corner of the office with no restrictions at all!

SMBeagle crawls these shares and lists out all the files it can read and write. If it can read them, so can ransomware.

SMBeagle can provide penetration testers with the less obvious routes to escalate privileges and move laterally.

By outputting directly into elasticsearch, testers can quickly find readable scripts and writeable executables.

Finding watering hole attacks and unprotected passwords never felt so easy!

                Whenever an attacker is trying to persist the access on a compromised machine, the first offensive approach usually involves the creation of a new identity. Nevertheless, this may not work easily under hardened environments with diverse detection mechanisms against common attack vectors.

What if we "suborn" Windows to create our own hidden account that will grant us total access to a victim, while stealthily impersonating any account we want?

Now it is possible with the Suborner Attack.

This technique will dynamically create an invisible machine account with custom credentials and custom properties without calling any user management Win32 APIs (e.g. netapi32.dll::netuseradd) and therefore evading detection mechanisms (e.g Event IDs 4720, 4721). By "suborning" Windows, we can also impersonate any desired account to keep our stealthiness even after a successful authentication/authorization.

To show its effectiveness, the attack is going to be demonstrated against the latest Windows version available.

                Modern attack emulation is a multi-step process involving different tools and techniques as testers execute custom workflows to achieve their objectives. One primary advantage of the Metasploit Framework is a unified approach to solving this problem.

This arsenal demonstration will cover some of the latest improvements to the Metasploit Framework and showcase how these improvements maximize effectiveness while performing common tasks. Viewers will see the latest workflows for capturing credentials, UI optimizations for running modules, and demonstrations of Metasploit's new payload-less session types. Capturing credentials is an integral part of many penetration testing methodologies and, when combined with the Metasploit database, can be a powerful technique for users engaged in breaching simulations. The latest features streamline configuring all the services Metasploit has capture modules for and managing them as a single unit. Users will also learn about some of the latest improvements related to pivoting in Metasploit, which allow capturing services to be started on compromised hosts when combined.

                IoT (Internet of Things) and OT (Operational Technology) are the current buzzwords for networked devices on which our modern society is based on. In this area, the used operating systems are summarized with the term firmware. The devices themselves, also called embedded devices, are essential in the private and industrial environments as well as in the so-called critical infrastructure.
Penetration testing of these systems is quite complex as we have to deal with different architectures, optimized operating systems and special protocols. EMBA is an open-source firmware analyzer with the goal to simplify and optimize the complex task of firmware security analysis. EMBA supports the penetration tester with the automated detection of 1-day vulnerabilities on binary level. This goes far beyond the plain CVE detection: With EMBA you always know which public exploits are available for the target firmware. Besides the detection of already known vulnerabilities, EMBA also supports the tester on the next 0-day. For this, EMBA identifies critical binary functions, protection mechanisms and services with network behavior on a binary level. There are many other features built into EMBA, such as fully automated firmware extraction, finding file system vulnerabilities, hard-coded credentials, and more.

EMBA is the open-source firmware scanner, created by penetration testers for penetration testers.

                Analyzing Firmware specifically to identify potential vulnerabilities is a common activity for security analysts, pentesters, researchers or engineers concerned with embedded devices such as in IoT. FACT offers an automated and usable platform to gain an immediate overview of potential vulnerabilities based on the firmware of a device and supercharges the process of finding deep vulnerabilities.

For this FACT automatically breaks down a firmware into its components, analyzes all components and summarizes the results. The analysis can then be perused in the desired amount of detail using either the responsive web application or a REST API.

The offered analyses include a list of included software and libraries, a matching of said software to CVE databases, identification of hard-coded credentials, private key material and weak configuration among others. FACT also applies source and binary code analysis to identify (possibly exploitable) bugs in the components and offers a large amount of meta data for further manual analysis.

A focus of recent development has been to offer more information regarding interdependencies between firmware components to ease the identification of data flow inside a firmware. This allows quickly grading the risk involved with uncovered vulnerabilities or configuration flaws by finding possible attack vectors concerning given component.

Finally, FACT offers multiple ways to collect and fuse analysis results, such as firmware comparison, advanced search options including regular expression on binary components and an integrated statistics module.

                Software supply chain attacks on open-source software ecosystems, particularly on popular package managers such as NPM, PyPI have increased tremendously in the last few years. Today, developers must thoroughly analyze packages, and avoid risky packages that may expose them to high levels of supply chain risks.

But, there exists no tool to measure supply chain risks lurking in open-source packages. Current practices include sourcing only mature, stable, popular, and reputable packages, where such attributes are inferred from publicly available metrics, such as GitHub stars, package downloads, and software development activity. However, such vanity metrics do not reveal true information about the security posture of packages. More importantly, an attacker-controlled bot can easily manipulate such metrics. Manually vetting hundreds of dependencies is infeasible.

In this talk, we will present our open-source command line vetting tool, called Packj that allows developers to easily analyze dependencies for "risky" code/attributes and provide actionable insights into their security posture. In this presentation, we will cover the technical details of our tool and discuss its usage. Packj tool powers also our large-scale security vetting infrastructure that continuously analyzes millions of published packages, and provides detailed risk assessment reports. We have already detected a number of abandoned, typo-squatting, and malicious packages. We will present our findings, highlight different types of attack techniques adopted by bad actors, and discuss measures that developers can take to thwart such attacks. With our work, we hope to enhance productivity of the developer community by exposing undesired behavior in untrusted third-party code, maintaining developer trust and reputation, and enforcing security of package managers.

                Since the release of the Log4Shell vulnerability (CVE-2021-44228), many tools were created to obfuscate Log4Shell payloads, making the lives of security engineers a nightmare.

Threat actors tend to apply obfuscation techniques to their payloads for several reasons. Most security protection tools, such as web application firewalls (WAFs), rely on rules to match malicious patterns. By using obfuscated payloads, threat actors are able to circumvent the rules logic and bypass security measures. Moreover, obfuscated payloads increase analysis complexity and, depending upon the degree of obfuscation, can also prevent them from being reverse-engineered.

Decoding and analyzing obfuscated payloads is time-consuming and often results in inaccurate data. However, doing so is crucial for understanding attackers' intentions.

We believe that security teams around the world can benefit from using Ox4Shell to dramatically reduce their analysis time. To help the security community, we have decided to release Ox4Shell - a payload deobfuscation tool that would make your life much easier.

                Linux seccomp is a simple, yet powerful tool to sandbox running processes and significantly decrease potential damage in case the application code gets exploited. It provides fine-grained controls for the process to declare what it can and can't do in advance and in most cases has zero performance overhead.

The only disadvantage: to utilize this framework, application developers have to explicitly add sandboxing code to their projects and developers usually either delay this or omit completely as their main focus is mostly on the functionality of the code rather than security. Moreover, the seccomp security model is based around system calls, but many developers, writing their code in high-level programming languages and frameworks, either have little knowledge to no experience with syscalls or just don't have easy-to-use seccomp abstractions or libraries for their frameworks.

All this makes seccomp not widely adoptedâ€”but what if there was a way to easily sandbox any application in any programming language without writing a single line of code? This presentation discusses potential approaches with their pros and cons.

                Siembol is an in-house developed security data processing application, forming the core of an internal Security Data Platform.

Following the experience of using Splunk, and as early adopters of Apache Metron, the team needed a highly efficient, real-time event processing engine with fewer limitations and more enhanced features. With Metron now retired, Siembol hopes to give the community an evolved alternative.

Siembol improvements over Metron:
- Components for real-time alert escalation: CSIRT teams can easily create a rule-based alert from a single data source, or they can create advanced correlation rules that combine various data sources. Moreover, Siembol UI supports importing a Sigma rule into Siembol alerting.
- Ability to integrate with other systems using dedicated components and plugin architecture for easy integration with incident response tools
- Advanced parsing framework for building fault-tolerant parsers
- Enhanced enrichment component allowing for defining rules and joining enrichment tables
- Configurations and rules are defined by a modern Angular web application, with a git-based approval process
- Supports OAuth2/OIDC for authentication and authorization in Siembol UI
- Easy installation for use with prepared docker images, helm charts and quick start guide

Siembol Use Cases:
- SIEM log collection using open-source technologies
- Detection tool for discovery of leaks and attacks on infrastructure
- Real-time stream Sigma rule evaluation without the need to index logs

                Slips is a behavioral-based intrusion prevention system, and the first free software to use machine learning to detect attacks in the network. It is a modular system that profiles the behavior of IP addresses and performs detections in time windows.
Slips' modules detect a range of attacks both to and from the protected devices.
Slips connects to other Slips using P2P, and exports alerts to other systems.

Slips works in several directionality modes. The user can choose to detect attacks coming *to* or going *from* these profiles. This makes it easy to protect your network but also to focus on infected computers inside your network.

Slips includes the download/management of external Threat Intelligence feeds (now working with 44 external feeds, including our own), whois/asn/geocountry/mac vendor enrichment, a LSTM neural net for malicious behavior detection, port scans, ICMP scans, long connection detection, data upload, malicious JA3/SSL certificate matching, leak detection and many more.
Ensembling algorithms are used for blocking decisions.
The P2P module connects to other Slips to share alerts.

Slips can read packets from an interface, PCAPs, Suricata, Zeek, Argus and Nfdump, and can output alerts files. Having Zeek as a base tool, Slips can correctly build a sorted timeline of flows combining all Zeek logs. Slips can send alerts using the STIX/TAXII protocol, to CESNET servers using IDEA0 format or to Slack.

The Kalipso Node.js interface allows the analysts to see the profiles' behaviors and detections performed by Slips modules directly in the console. Kalipso displays the flows of each profile and time window and compares those connections in charts/bars. It also summarizes the whois/asn/geocountry information for each IP in your traffic. Kalipso is being migrated to a web console.

                Over the last 10 years, many threat groups have employed stegomalware or other steganography-based techniques to attack organizations from all sectors and in all regions of the world. Some examples are: APT15/Vixen Panda, APT23/Tropic Trooper, APT29/Cozy Bear, APT32/OceanLotus, APT34/OilRig, APT37/ScarCruft, APT38/Lazarus Group, Duqu Group, Turla, Vawtrack, Powload, Lokibot, Ursnif, IceID, etc.
Our research shows that most groups are employing very simple techniques (at least from an academic perspective) and known tools to circumvent perimeter defenses, although more advanced groups are also using steganography to hide C&C communication and data exfiltration. We argue that this lack of sophistication is not due to the lack of knowledge in steganography (some APTs have already experimented with advanced algorithms) but simply because organizations are not able to defend themselves, even against the simplest steganography techniques.
During the demonstration we will show the practical limitations of applying existing automated steganalysis techniques for companies that want to prevent infections or information theft by these threat actors.
For this reason, we have created stegoWiper, a tool to blindly disrupt any image-based stegomalware, attacking the weakest point of all steganography algorithms: their robustness. We'll show that it is capable of disrupting all steganography techniques and tools (Invoke-PSImage, F5, Steghide, openstego, ...) employed nowadays, as well as the most advanced algorithms available in the academic literature, based on matrix encryption, wet-papers, etc. (e.g. Hill, J-Uniward, Hugo). In fact, the more sophisticated a steganography technique is, the more disruption stegoWiper produces.
Moreover, our active attack allows us to disrupt any steganography payload from all the images exchanged by an organization by means of a web proxy ICAP (Internet Content Adaptation Protocol) service, in real time and without having to identify which images contain hidden data first.

                SubParse is a modular framework designed for the automation of malware analysis using static and dynamic analysis, external threat intelligence sources and historical data/event correlation. The novelty of this approach comes in the correlation of extracted data to not only assist in identification of current samples, but also in correlating any facet of information with other samples stored within the framework. Data will be accessible through an intuitive web-based user interface which offers a comprehensive filter syntax sub-system.

Static file identification and parsing is the entry point into the framework. Currently, the scope of the framework is to support Windows-based portable executable (PE) files and Linux executables (ELF). However, the modularity of the framework allows for the easy integration of additional file parsers through plugins. Static file characteristics can be extracted using file format parsing, such as: file hashes, compile time, version information, code entry address, and section information. Across a larger sample set these attributes can offer unique views into threat actor operations and allow for the correlation of previously uncorrelated samples.

Analysis can be further enriched using enricher plugins. After completion of the static file parsing, the framework looks for any enabled enrichers. Enrichers provide an open-ended opportunity to gather additional data about the sample and add it to the framework. For example, an enricher that utilizes services provided by Abuse.ch can provide additional insight into malware behavior.

Another key enricher provides dynamic analysis. The framework will orchestrate dynamic analysis using a CAPEv2 sandbox. Dynamic analysis will provide behavioral insights into the malware, such as process activity, memory allocations and network activity. These results will be exported from CAPE and correlated with the sample within SubParse. For these artifacts, they will be submitted to the framework for full analysis and correlated to the original sample.

Threshold key generation and threshold key agreement are used to provide end-to-end security of data in transmission and data at rest without requiring any additional user interactions.

Once a device is connected to a user's personal Mesh through a simple, one-time configuration step, all private key and credential management functions are automated. Devices may be provisioned with private keys required to support applications such as OpenPGP, S/MIME and SSH according to intended use of that device.

                As the open-source ecosystem keeps growing, and applications increase their reliance on public libraries, we also see a spike in supply chain attacks. Recent scandals like SolarWinds or Log4j remind us how exposed software is when it comes to malicious, vulnerable or broken packages. Modern applications have thousands of dependencies, which means that managing dependency trees only becomes harder over time, while exposure keeps rising.

Think about how often you need things like

- keeping execution environments frozen for a strict dependency control (I'm looking at you, supply chain attacks);
- running applications locally so you can try whatever you are coding;
- executing CI/CD pipelines locally so you can make sure jobs (Linters, tests, deployments, etc.) are passing;
- running applications anywhere, no matter what OS you are using;
- knowing the exact dependency tree your application has for properly managing risk (Software Bill of Materials);
- making sure applications will work as expected in production environments.

At Fluid Attacks, we have experienced such concerns firsthand. That is why we created Makes, an open-source framework for building CI/CD pipelines and application environments in a way that is

- secure: Direct and indirect dependencies for both applications and CI/CD pipelines are cryptographically signed, granting an immutable software supply chain;
- easy: Can be installed with just one command and has dozens of generic CI/CD builtins;
- fast: Supports a distributed and completely granular cache;
- portable: Runs on Docker, VM's, and any Linux-based OS;
- extensible: Can be extended to work with any technology.

Makes is production ready and used currently in 11 different products that range from static and dynamic websites to vulnerability scanners. It was released on GitHub in July 2021 and has already been starred 170 times. It currently has 9 contributors from the community and gets a minor update each month.

                Vulnerabilities in various android systems such as the AOSP and vendor-specific components directly impact user security & privacy and should be eliminated. Do we have a way to efficiently identify bugs in ready-to-ship phones conveniently and precisely? From a researcher perspective, vendor codes are mainly closed-source which means they cannot use open-source auditing tools and usually the only obtainable resource is phone firmware. From vendor QA and security team's perspective, the ability to perform a systematic vulnerability assessment directly on ready-to-ship phone images would also be much more useful and easier than maintaining complex dependency and version information on each model.

We come up with a framework named RIDE (Rom Intelligent Defect assEsment) that directly operates on factory images of major android systems such as AOSP, Samsung, Huawei, Xiaomi, Oppo etc, which discovered 40+ CVEs including critical and high severity level bugs in the vendors in less than one year. RIDE combines highly precise whole-program static taint analysis and dynamic blackbox binary fuzzing to pinpoint vulnerabilities in user-space code such as system apps, system services and bundled closed-source libraries. In this talk, we will share in detail about the system's design and architecture, including the whole-program static analysis algorithm and implementation with high precision and acceptable performance, and the blackbox fuzzing component which is fed by the information collected from previous static analysis. Also, we will share the detail and exploitation of several bugs found, which range from system-level arbitrary file read/write/code execution to RCE ones in AOSP and other major vendors etc.

We stick to the format standard as much as possible when deriving these offsets, and we clearly define what we want out of identified chunks (e.g., not extracting meta-data to disk, padding removal).

This strategy helps us feed known valid data to extractors and precisely identify unidentified chunks, turning unknown unknowns into known unknowns.

Given the modular design of unblob and the ever expanding repository of supported formats, unblob could be used in areas outside of embedded security such as data recovery, memory forensics, or malware analysis.

unblob has been developed with the following objectives in mind:

* Accuracy - chunk start offsets are identified using battle tested rules, while end offsets are computed according to the format's standard without deviating from it. We minimize false positives as much as possible by validating header structures and discarding overflowing chunks.
* Security - unblob does not require elevated privileges to run. It's heavily tested and has been fuzz tested against a large corpus of files and firmware images. We rely on up-to-date third party dependencies that are locked to limit potential supply chain issues. We use safe extractors that we audited and fixed where required (e.g., path traversal in ubi_reader, path traversal in jefferson, integer overflow in Yara).
* Extensibility - unblob exposes an API that can be used to write custom format handlers and extractors in no time.
* Speed - we want unblob to be blazing fast, that's why we use multi-processing by default, make sure to write efficient code, use memory-mapped files, and use Hyperscan as high-performance matching library. Computation intensive functions are written in Rust and called from Python using specific bindings.
