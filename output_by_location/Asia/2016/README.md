When it comes to the security of the information system, Active Directory domain controllers are, or should be, at the center of concerns, which are (normally) to ensure compliance with best practices, and during a compromise proved to explore the possibility of cleaning the information system without having to rebuild Active Directory. Indeed, backdoors can be implemented in Active Directory to help an intruder to gain back his privileges. However, few tools implement this cleaning/survey process despite several ways existing for backdooring Active Directory.We propose to present some possible backdoors which could be set by an intruder in Active Directory to keep administration rights. For example, how to modify the AdminSDHolder container in order to reapply rights after administrator actions. Then, we will present BTA, an audit tool for Active Directory databases, and our methodology for verifying the application of good practices and the absence of malicious changes in these databases. One of example, that we will show, is how to spot accounts which have DCSync rights and pulls account credentials through the standard Domain Controller replication API.The presentation will be organized as follows:We begin by describing the stakes around the Active Directory, centerpiece of any information system based on Microsoft technologies.We will continue by demonstrating some backdoors in order to keep admins rights or to help an intruder to quickly recover admins rights.We will present BTA and the methodology developed to analysis Active Directory.We conclude with a feedback on real world usage of BTA.More information can be found on the Bitbucket repository: https: //bitbucket.org/iwseclabs/bta

![BH-ASIA-16](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ASIA-16-blue) ![Tool](https://img.shields.io/badge/Tool-green) ![Sanoop Thomas](https://img.shields.io/badge/Sanoop%20Thomas-informational)
Halcyon is the first unofficial IDE for Nmap script development. The existing challenge in developing Nmap Scripts (NSE) is the lack of an IDE that gives easiness in building custom scripts for real world scanning. Halcyon is free to use, java based application that has code intelligence, code builder, auto-completion, debugging and error correction and a bunch of other features similar like other development IDE(s) for traditional programming languages. This research was started to give better development interface/environment to researchers and thus enhance the number of NSE writers in the community. Halcyon IDE can understand Nmap library and traditional LUA syntax as well. At the same time it also comes with an offline Nmap wiki that helps Nmap script writers an easy way to access development library references. Possible repetitive codes such as web crawling, bruteforcing etc., is pre-built in the IDE and this makes easy for script writers to save their time while development majority of test scenarios. The IDE gives options to debug the code, make code error free, export the code to the library and several other pre/post development tasks from within the same interface itself.

Pocsuite is an open-source remote vulnerability testing framework developed by the Knownsec Security Team.Written in Python and supported both validation and exploitation two plugin-invoked modes, Pocsuite could import batch targets from files and test them against multiple exploit-plugins in advance.There are two ways to work with Pocsuite: configuring exploit-required arguments and running in console-based modes; and handling the output from steps in interactive modes. Besides, it could display output in a human-friendly graph providing more useful information for pentesters.Like Metasploit, it is a development kit for pentesters to develop their own exploits. Users could utilize some auxiliary modules packaged in Pocsuite to extend their exploit functions or integrate Pocsuite to develop other vulnerability assessment tools.At last, Pocsuite is also an extremely useful tool to integrate Seebug and ZoomEye APIs in a collaborative way. Vulnerability assessment can be done automatically and effectively by searching targets through ZoomEye and acquiring PoC scripts from Seebug or locally.

Rudra aims to provide a developer-friendly framework for exhaustive analysis of (PCAP and PE) files. It provides features to scan and generate reports that include file's structural properties, entropy visualization, compression ratio, theoretical minsize, etc. These details, alongwith file-format specific analysis information, help an analyst to understand the type of data embedded in a file and quickly decide if it deserves further investigation.Rudra is the only tool to provide an effective bot based query mechanism for scanning files. Users can use Twitter and mention a Pastebin link that stores the base64 encoded version of the file to be scanned. It will pull the file from Pastebin, perform base64 decoding, initiate scanning on decoded file, submit base64 encoded json report to Pastebin and post a reply tweet with its link. This provides a quick and effective option to try Rudra without installing it.Rudra supports scanning PE files and can perform API scans, anti{debug, vm, sandbox} detection, packer detection, authenticode verification, alongwith Yara, shellcode, and regex detection upon them. Additionally, following new features are being added for the first beta release:Interactive console providing access to all internal data structures and objects, exposing a rich API for usersPlugin architecture to operate upon decoded file content (usecases might be to write a decoder for a new RAT found in the wild or to write a custom unpacker for a binary stub, etc.)Extracting subfiles and optionally scanning them if neededHeuristics to identify suspicious network flows and exe filesThe report for each analyzed file can be dumped to disk as a JSON/HTML/PDF. If needed, analysis can be customized via CLI arguments, config file, or interactive console.Rudra also supports protocol identification, decoding, and normalization. It can analyze embedded URLs and IP addresses within files and gather whois/geolocation information for them. Users can view live mapping of identified hosts and correlate the results from different analysis modules to perform deeper investigation.

SAIVS can crawl Web applications that include dynamic pages such as "login," "create account" and "information search".It can find for vulnerabilities. SAIVS can find vulnerabilities such as "Cross Site Scripting" and "SQL Injection".It can output a scanning report. SAIVS can output a scanning report. The report includes target URLs and location of the found vulnerabilities.SAIVS can also perform the following human-like actions: "SAIVS recognizes the type of the page. If it crawls the login page without having a login credential, it creates login credential in the create account page. After it log in with the created login credentials, it crawls the rest of the pages and scans for vulnerabilities. When it finishes all pages, it outputs a scanning report." SAIVS uses machine learning algorithms such as Naive Bayes, Q-Learning, Multi-layer Perceptron in order to achieve one of the aforementioned capabilities: It can crawl simple Web applications. Our session will explain how this ability was made possible by the machine learning algorithms.

### ZoomEye - CyberSpace Search Engine
![BH-ASIA-16](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ASIA-16-blue) ![Tool](https://img.shields.io/badge/Tool-green) ![Zhou Yang](https://img.shields.io/badge/Zhou%20Yang-informational)
ZoomEye is a cyberspace search engine released in 2013. Unlike Shodan which only crawls the port fingerprints of Internet-connected devices and does less work on fingerprint parsing, ZoomEye crawls on not only Internet-connected devices, but also websites to get the fingerprints. All of these fingerprints are powered by our two major engines Xmap and Wmap. Xmap is specialized to port scanning, and Wmap focuses on Web Application fingerprint crawling and parsing.We distribute the crawlers running 7/24 across the world, providing both host device and web application searches to the public by crawling and indexing. Users can also achieve integration and automation with our platform API.This talk covers a basic introduction on our crawling and analyzing architecture, some thoughts on scanning crawling strategies, and the major process on parsing and analyzing devices and website fingerprints.To better understand the complexity of the cyberspace, we work hard on fingerprint parsing and analysis to get more detailed and complete metadata. We think that more accurate and formatted data will do great help to our research. Besides, some cases will be demonstrated in comparison with Shodan and Censys.io to prove our strengths.The ZoomEye 101 section introduces how ZoomEye helps to enhance our research or do some hacking stuff. The audience will learn not only the revolution history of ZoomEye, but also some helpful Internet research methodologies.
