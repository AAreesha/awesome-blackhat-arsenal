                CommandoVM is an open-source Windows-based security distribution designed for Penetration Testers and Red Teamers. It is an add-on from FireEye's very successful Reverse Engineering distribution: FLARE VM. Much like Kali Linux, CommandoVM is designed with an arsenal of open-source offensive tools that will help operators achieve assessment objectives.

Being built on Windows, CommandoVM comes with all the native support for accessing Active Directory environments. CommandoVM includes Web Application assessment tools, scripting languages (such as Python and Go), Information Gathering tools (such as Nmap, WireShark, and PowerView), Exploitation Tools (such as PowerSploit, GhostPack and Mimikatz), Persistence tools, Lateral Movement tools, Evasion tools, Post-Exploitation tools (such as FireEye's SessionGopher), Android Hacking tools, Remote Access tools, Command-Line tools, and all the might of FLARE VM's reversing tools.

Quality-of-Life changes to the OS include: disabling UAC, Windows Defender and Windows Firewall, disabling LLMNR and NetBIOS , having some pinned applications (CMD, PowerShell, Sublime Text, VS Code) run as administrator automatically, as well as added context menu options like "Open With Sublime Text" and "Open Command Prompt Here" to ease the frustration of working with a Windows pen-testing environment. CommandoVM strives to be your go-to Windows environment for penetration tests, red team engagements, and Capture-the-Flag events.

                Halcyon IDE lets you quickly and easily develop Nmap scripts for performing advanced scans on applications and infrastructures with a wide range capabilities from recon to exploitation. It is the first IDE released exclusively for Nmap script development. Halcyon IDE is a free and open-sourced project (always will be) released under MIT license to provide an easier development interface for rapidly growing information security community around the world. The project was initially started as an evening free-time "coffee shop" project and has taken a serious step for its developer/contributors to spend dedicated time for its improvements very actively.

                FullContact allows you to search on an e-mail address, Twitter username, location, name, company, and alias or verify an e-mail address.

Maltego is a link analysis application of technical infrastructure and/or social media networks from disparate sources of Open Source INTelligence (OSINT). Maltego is listed on the Top 10 Security Tools for Kali Linux by Network World and Top 125 Network Security Tools by the Nmap Project.

The integration of FullContact with Maltego links the input to it's e-mail address, Twitter username, location, name, company and alias in an easy to understand graph format that can be enriched with other sources of data.

                RTS (Realtime scrapper) is a tool developed to scrap all pasties, github, reddit, etc. in real time to identify occurrence of search terms configured. Upon match, an email will be triggered. Thus, allowing a company to react in case of leakage of code, any hacks tweeted, etc. and harden themselves against an attack before it goes viral.

                NFC Scrambler is an android app that emulates a rfid card to prevent nfc skimming. Rfid cards are used nearly everywhere, either in the forms of identification cards or credit cards. RFID Skimming statistics reveal that every two seconds a new case of identity theft is reported in the United States; however, not everyone can afford a rfid blocker card or wallet. Thus this app will help them block rfid skimming for free.

                To perform malicious actions, attackers create malware; however, they cannot achieve their goals unless their attempts remain undetected. There is a cat and-mouse game between defenders and attackers, which includes attackers monitoring the operations of security technologies and practices.

The Unprotect Project is an open-source project that aims to propose a complete classification about Evasion Techniques to help to understand and analyze a malware. This project is dedicated to Windows PE malware but will be extended to other platforms in the future.

                VoIP Wireshark Attack-Defense Toolkit is a collection of Wireshark plugins which enables a pentester to analyze VoIP traffic. The toolkit can provide summary of VoIP traffic, automatically decrypt VoIP calls wherever possible, export the call audio to popular formats, detect attacks/misconfigurations, and highlight the DTMF/SMS interactions. This eliminates the need for a separate software/framework to analyze VoIP traffic. The plugins are written in Lua and are easy to add to Wireshark. And, the toolkit, just like Wireshark, is platform independent.
