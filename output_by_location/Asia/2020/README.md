                DFEX - [DNS File EXfiltration]

Data exfiltration is a common technique used for post-exploitation, DNS is one of the most common protocols through firewalls.
We take the opportunity to build a unique protocol for transferring files across the network.

Existing tools have some limitations and NG Firewalls are getting a bit "smarter", we have been obliged to explore new combinations of tactics to bypass these. Using the good old fashion "HIPS" (Hidden In Plain Sigh) tricks to push files out.

                PEASS - Privilege Escalation Awesome Scripts SUITE is as the name suggests a collection of privilege escalation scripts. We have a script for Linux, Windows and a Windows .net4 executable. We are launching macOSx version at Black Hat Asia 2020. These tools search for possible local privilege escalation paths that you could exploit and print them with nice colours so you can recognise misconfigurations easily.

                ModSecurity is a toolkit for real-time web application monitoring, logging, and access control. I like to think about it as an enabler: there are no hard rules telling you what to do; instead, it is up to you to choose your own path through the available features.

                Nettacker project was created to automated for information gathering, vulnerability scanning and eventually generating a report for networks, including services, bugs, vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and information. This software is able to use SYN, ACK, TCP, ICMP and many other protocols to detect and bypass the Firewalls/IDS/IPS and devices. By using a unique solution in Nettacker to find protected services such as SCADA, we could make a point to be one of the bests of scanners.

                People in IT eco-system are becoming 'favorite' targets because, 1. they remain weakest link and 2. organisation are becoming mature in securing technology. For a security tester, it is a daunting task to set up a phishing campaign, which includes, decide a look-alike domain, buy it, setup a phishing website with infrastructure, design an email and choose target audience, track the open/click/download and build the analytics. All of these activities are time-consuming and demands a certain skill-set.

Phishing Simulation provides one-stop-solution for organisation to understand security awareness posture without actually performing 'live' phishing attack. Phishing Simulation prepares phishing assessment with tailor-made questions specific to organisation, facilitates target users to complete the assessment, provides an intuitive tutorial and builds the analytics on basis of responses and the meta-data collected about user.

Phishing Simulation has 2 modules:
Admin Module: This module will be used by tester to setup and monitor phishing assessments
- On the basis of inputs provided by tester like organisation name, email ID, domain name, tool automatically generates questions with tailor-made data such as look-alike domains using typo-squatting technique, spoofed sender address, look-alike web-site content
- Assessment will comprise of questions having phishing web-site, spear-phishing email, SMiShing, scenario-based question to make it close to real-world phishing attacks
- Tool also provides analytics in form of graphs to represent security awareness posture of organisation by different categories such as department, employee, target-user action

Client Module: This module will be used by target user to complete the assessment and view tutorial
- Every user within a campaign itself will have 10 unique questions to answer, with the mix of positive and negative scenarios
- Passing criteria is to answer every question correct because all it takes is just one click!

                The OWASP Risk Assessment Framework consist of Static Application Security Testing and Risk Assessment tools. Even though there are many SAST tools available for testers, the compatibility and the environment setup process is complex. By using OWASP Risk Assessment Framework's Static Application Security Testing tool, testers will be able to analyze and review their code quality and vulnerabilities without any additional setup. OWASP Risk Assessment Framework can be integrated in the DevSecOps toolchain to help developers to write and produce secure code.

                Vulmap is an open source online local vulnerability scanner project. It consists of online local vulnerability scanning scripts for Windows and Linux. These scripts can be used for defensive and offensive purposes. It is possible to conduct vulnerability assessments by using these scripts. Also they can be used for privilege escalation by pentesters/red teamers. Vulmap scans vulnerabilities on localhost, shows related exploits and downloads them. It basically, scan localhost to gather installed software information and ask Vulmon API if there are any vulnerabilities and exploits related with installed software. If any vulnerability exists, Vulmap shows CVE ID, risk score, vulnerability's detail link, exploit ids and exploit titles. Exploits can be downloaded with Vulmap also. Main idea of Vulmap is getting real-time vulnerability data from Vulmon instead of relying of a local vulnerability database. Even the most recent vulnerabilities can be detected with this approach. Also its exploit download feature helps privilege escalation process. Since most Linux installations have Python, Vulmap Linux is developed with Python while Vulmap Windows is developed with PowerShell to make it easy to run it on most Windows versions without any installation.

<details><summary><strong>[Vuls: Agent-less Vulnerability Scanner for Linux, FreeBSD, Container Image, Running Container, WordPress, Application Libraries, and Network Devices](https://github.com/future-architect/vuls)</strong></summary>

                ![BH-ARSENAL](https://img.shields.io/badge/BH-ARSENAL-blue) ![Category: Red Teaming / AppSec](https://img.shields.io/badge/Category:%20Red%20Teaming%20/%20AppSec-red) ![Kota Kanbe](https://img.shields.io/badge/Kota%20Kanbe-informational)

                Over 10,000 new vulnerabilities are registered on the NVD each year. Constantly monitoring new vulnerabilities and keeping a manual inventory of installed software to determine which devices are affected is necessary. Without automation, vulnerability lifecycle managed imposes huge burdens and challenges.

Having personally experienced these challenges, Kota Kanbe created Vuls, an open source vulnerability scanner for Linux and FreeBSD [https://github.com/future-architect/vuls].

With users worldwide, Vuls has over 7,000 GitHub stars and is the highest-ranked security-tool https://github.com/topics/security-tools

Vuls lets you know which servers and software are affected by newly disclosed vulnerabilities. Using multiple detection methods and data sources including changelog, Package Manager, NVD and OVAL, Vuls is more accurate than other open source scanners.

Additionally, using CPE offers a wide detection range. Vuls not only detects vulnerabilities in OS packages but also in non-OS packages such as libraries for programming languages and network devices. https://vuls.io/docs/en/usage-scan-non-os-packages.html Wordpress vulnerability scanning(core, plugins, themes) is also supported. Scan WordPress ... https://vuls.io/docs/en/usage-scan-wordpress.html

Another important feature is the speed; by using parallel processing, numerous servers can be scanned at high speeds with most scans completed within 10 seconds.

Vuls supports major distributions of Linux and FreeBSD as well as containers such as Docker, LXC and LXD.

Vuls is extremely easy to set up since it connects to other servers via SSH for the scans. Of course, it can also be used to scan servers locally without SSH.

Vuls is a Dynamic Scanner which logs in running servers. This means that it's possible to acquire the useful state of the server for system administrators. For instance, Vuls will let you know if there are processes affected by an update and when daemons forgot to perform a restart after the update.

With non-intrusive scans, Vuls works well with Continuous Integration and can help find vulnerabilities very quickly by conducting scans every day.

How can a system administrator automate vulnerability lifecycle management?
