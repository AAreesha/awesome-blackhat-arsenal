📝 **Description:** The core idea of AiCEF, is to harness the intelligence that is available from online and MISP reports, as well as threat groups' activities, arsenal etc., from, e.g., MITRE, to create relevant and timely cybersecurity exercises. To this end, we have developed a specialised ontology called Cyber Exercise Scenario Ontology (CESO), which extends STIX [2]. The core idea is to map reports; both from online resources and MISP, via a common ontology to graphs. This way, we abstract the events from the reports in a machine-readable form. The produced graphs can be infused with additional intelligence, e.g. the threat actor profile from MITRE, also mapped in our ontology. While this may fill gaps that would be missing from a report, one can also manipulate the graph to create custom and unique models. Finally, we exploit transformer-based language models like GPT to convert the graph into text that can serve as the scenario of a cybersecurity exercise.
We have tested and validated AiCEF with a group of experts in cybersecurity exercises, and the results clearly show that AiCEF significantly augments the capabilities in creating timely and relevant cybersecurity exercises in terms of both quality and time.

🔗 **Link:** [Backdoor Pony: Evaluating Backdoor Attacks and Defenses in Different Domains](#)  
📝 **Description:** Outsourced training and crowdsourced datasets lead to a new threat for deep
learning models: the backdoor attack. In this attack, the adversary inserts a
secret functionality in a model, activated through malicious inputs. Backdoor
attacks represent an active research area due to diverse settings where they
represent a real threat. Still, there is no framework to evaluate existing
attacks and defenses in different domains. Only a few toolboxes have been
implemented, but most of them focus on computer vision and are difficult
to use. To bridge this gap, we present Backdoor Pony, a framework for
evaluating attacks and defenses in different domains through a user-friendly
GUI.

🔗 **Link:** [GodPotato: As Long as You Have the ImpersonatePrivilege Permission, Then You are the SYSTEM!](#)  
📝 **Description:** Based on the history of Potato privilege escalation for 6 years, from the beginning of RottenPotato to the end of JuicyPotatoNG, I discovered a new technology by researching DCOM, which enables privilege escalation in Windows 2012 - Windows 2022, now as long as you have "ImpersonatePrivilege" permission. Then you are "NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM", usually WEB services and database services have "ImpersonatePrivilege" permissions.



Potato privilege escalation is usually used when we obtain WEB/database privileges. We can elevate a service user with low privileges to "NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM" privileges.
However, the historical Potato has no way to run on the latest Windows system. When I was researching DCOM, I found a new method that can perform privilege escalation. There are some defects in rpcss when dealing with oxid, and rpcss is a service that must be opened by the system. , so it can run on almost any Windows OS, I named it GodPotato

🔗 **Link:** [Remove-Signature](#)  
📝 **Description:** Remove-Signature is a tool designed to automate the process of generating a payload that can bypass anti-virus detection.

During red team testing, red team operators often need to prepare a payload that will not be detected by anti-virus software in order to be successful. One way to do this is to identify where the signatures used by anti-virus software are located in the payload, and then modifies bytes of the locations so that the modified payload will not be detected as malicious. This process can be time-consuming.

Remove-Signature aims to automate this process by identifying the signatures in the payload, and modifying a single byte of the signatures location in a way that will bypass anti-virus detection, while still maintaining the functionality of the payload. The tool understands the PE file format and only makes modifications that will not affect the payload's functionality. Unlike other existing tools that can only identify signatures, Remove-Signature is able to automatically generate a modified payload that can evade anti-virus detection.

The use of Remove-Signature can help to reduce the workload of red team operators and allow them to focus on other aspects of the red team engagement.

🔗 **Link:** [N3XT G3N WAF 2.0](#)  
📝 **Description:** Previously, we introduced N3XT G3N WAF (NGWAF) 1.0 at BHUSA 2022. The novel WAF 3.0 tool that seeks to relieve complex and difficult WAF detection mechanism with detection utilising a Sequential Neural Network (SNN) and traps attackers through a custom honeypotted environment. These assets are all dockerised for scalability.

However, further experiments have proven that a SNN may not be the most optimal when it comes down to contextualised defence as it processes information in a step by step and sequential manner. It gets relatively cumbersome and ineffective detecting chained or contexualised attacks. Both of which are extremely common in today's attacks.

Thus, we took another approach by swapping out our "brains". We revamped the SNN and went with a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). The RNN is a much better choice for contextualised defense as the output of each layer is fed back as the input of the same layer. Thus, this allows the network to maintain a "memory" of the data it has processed. Our latest model is a RNN with a bi-directional LSTM module, it has an accuracy of 0.995 and a f1 score of 0.993.

We have also upgraded NGWAF's scalability in model deployment, model maintenance and the overall detection pipeline. This is all done with cloudifying the operations of the entire Machine Learning detection module. As compared to version 1.0 where users have to install and run the entire framework on their local system, NGWAF 2.0 has employed Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) scripts, which auto-deploys the machine learning model's training & maintenance pipeline onto AWS resources (Sagemaker). The detection module has also been shifted from local deployment to AWS Sagemaker where we are able to standardise the hardware utilised for the ML model. This also allows further decoupling of the detection module from the rest of the system and allow for greater customisability.

🔗 **Link:** [Forecasting ATT&CK Flow by Recommendation System Based on APT](#)  
📝 **Description:** Our tool is to forecast undetected ATT&CK techniques based on collaborative filtering and graph databases.
PCs and servers are generating massive logs daily, on the other hand, SOCs analysts are required to detect and respond quickly to cyber-attacks. However, it will take a lot of time to detect cyber-attacks if SOC analysts do not have clues. Conventional log analysis tools such as SIEM can detect attacks but cannot predict the next attack from the information already obtained. Recommendation systems often used in e-commerce sites can predict future purchasing behavior by analyzing the user's purchase history. Replacing with ATT&CK, each attacker group can be considered a user, and techniques attackers use can be regarded as a user's purchase history.
Using this tool, the logs are mapped to ATT&CK techniques by uploading log files to create a technique usage history of the attacker (adversary) currently conducting an ongoing attack. The adversary's technique usage history and past APT attack data are used for collaborative filtering to predict which techniques the adversary may use in the future. This visualization is　displayed together with the ATT&CK tactic, enabling you to see the attack flow in stages of progression. In addition, search queries of SIEM associated with forecasted ATT&CK technique are outputted. SOC analysts can consider attacks quickly and comprehensively by using queries.
The source code of this tool and an example analysis will be shown on GitHub. It is available as a web application.

🔗 **Link:** [StegoWiper+: A Powerful and Flexible Active Attack for Disrupting Stegomalware and Advanced Stegography](https://github.com/mindcrypt/stegowiper)  
📝 **Description:** Over the last 10 years, many threat groups have employed stegomalware or other steganography-based techniques to attack organizations from all sectors and in all regions of the world. Some examples are: APT15/Vixen Panda, APT23/Tropic Trooper, APT29/Cozy Bear, APT32/OceanLotus, APT34/OilRig, APT37/ScarCruft, APT38/Lazarus Group, Duqu Group, Turla, Vawtrack, Powload, Lokibot, Ursnif, IceID, etc.Our research shows that most groups are employing very simple techniques (at least from an academic perspective) and known tools to circumvent perimeter defenses, although more advanced groups are also using steganography to hide C&C communication and data exfiltration. We argue that this lack of sophistication is not due to the lack of knowledge in steganography (some APTs have already experimented with advanced algorithms) but simply because organizations are not able to defend themselves, even against the simplest steganography techniques.

During the demonstration we will show the practical limitations of applying existing automated steganalysis techniques for companies that want to prevent infections or information theft by these threat actors. For this reason, we have created stegoWiper, a tool to blindly disrupt any image-based stegomalware, attacking the weakest point of all steganography algorithms: their robustness. We'll show that it is capable of disrupting all steganography techniques and tools (Invoke-PSImage, F5, Steghide, openstego, ...) employed nowadays. In fact, the more sophisticated a steganography technique is, the more disruption stegoWiper produces. Moreover, our active attack allows us to disrupt any steganography payload from all the images exchanged by an organization by means of a web proxy ICAP (Internet Content Adaptation Protocol) service, in real time and without having to identify which images contain hidden data first.

After our presentation at BlackHat USA 2022 Arsenal we have been working on supporting, disrupting, state-of-the-art advanced algorithms available in the academic literature, based on matrix encryption, wet-papers, etc. (e.g. Hill, J-Uniward, Hugo). Especially we have paid attention to the YASS algorithm (https://pboueke.github.io/CryptoStego/) resistant to numerous active attacks and commercial CDR-type software. Finally our tool is able to defeat them.

🔗 **Link:** [White Phoenix - Beating Intermittent Encryption](https://github.com/mittidesai/Stock-Market-Prediction/blob/master/120_clusters)  
📝 **Description:** Intermittent Encryption (aka Partial Encryption) is a new trend in the world of ransomware. It's been adopted by many notorious groups such as BlackCat Ransomware, Play Ransomware and more. Altogether, the groups using intermittent encryption have successfully targeted hundreds of organizations in 2022 alone. However, even though intermittent encryption has its advantages, it leaves much of the content of targeted files unencrypted. In this talk, we will demonstrate a tool that uses this limitation to recover valuable data, such as text and images from documents encrypted by these groups, allowing the victims to recover some of their lost data.

🔗 **Link:** [KICS - Your IaC Secure Now!](#)  
📝 **Description:** KICS stands for Keeping Infrastructure as Code Secure. It is open source and is a must-have for any cloud native project to find security vulnerabilities, compliance issues, and infrastructure misconfigurations early in the development cycle of the underlying infrastructure-as-code (IaC).

KICS supports about 20 different technologies including Terraform, Cloudformation, Kubernetes, Docker, over several cloud providers like AWS, Microsoft Azure or Google Cloud. It is the only open-source project that has achieved any Center for Internet Security (CIS) certification.

KICS is fully customizable and extensible by the addition of rules for new vulnerabilities. It is available as a Docker image, and is paired in multiple platforms to leverage its integration on the development life-cycle and the DevSecOps mentality of its users. Gitlab has chosen KICS as its default IaC scanner; it is also available in ArgoHub, as a hook in TerraformCloud or as a Github Action for Github workflows.

One of the most recent features of KICS is auto remediation. With this feature KICS goes full cycle in preventing vulnerable code from going into production by scanning the code, exposing the issues, and automatically remediating them. Such a feature is both available from the CLI interface, or via a plugin for the Visual Studio Code editor, where we bring together auto-remediation and real-time scanning. As the developer writes IaC scripts, KICS automatically looks for vulnerabilities, proposes fixes and remediates them. By the time the IaC scripts are finished, developers are rest assured that it is safe to go into production. This is shift-left security brought to its splendor.

🔗 **Link:** [uftrace: Dynamic Function Tracing Tool for C/C++/Rust programs](#)  
📝 **Description:** uftrace is a function tracing tool that helps in the analysis of C/C++/Rust programs. It hooks into the entry and exit of each function, recording timestamps as well as the function's arguments and return values. uftrace is capable of tracing both user and kernel functions, as well as library functions and system events providing an integrated execution flow in a single timeline.

Initially, uftrace only supported function tracing with compiler support. However, it now allows users to trace function calls without recompilation by analyzing instructions in each function prologue and dynamically and selectively patching those instructions.

Users can also write and run scripts for each function entry and exit using python/luajit APIs to create custom tools for their specific purposes.

uftrace offers various filters to reduce the amount of trace data and provides visualization using Chrome trace viewer and flame graphs, allowing for a big picture view of the execution flow.

uftrace was open sourced in 2016 and has been developed at https://github.com/namhyung/uftrace.
