                Archery is an open-source vulnerability assessment and management tool which helps developers and pentesters to perform scans and manage vulnerabilities. Archery uses popular open-source tools to perform comprehensive scanning for web application and network. It also performs web application dynamic authenticated scanning and covers the whole applications by using selenium. The developers can also utilize the tool for implementation of their DevOps CI/CD environment.The main capabilities of our Archery include:Perform Web and Network Vulnerability Scanning using open-source tools.Correlates and Collaborate all raw scans data, show them in a consolidated manner.Perform authenticated web scanning.Perform web application scanning using selenium.Vulnerability Management.Enable REST API's for developers to perform scanning and Vulnerability Management.Useful for DevOps teams for Vulnerability Management.More documentation here:https://archerysec.github.io/archerysec/

                The idea behind Faraday is to help you to share all the information that is generated during a pentest, vulnerability assessment or scan without changing the way you work. You run a command, import a report, and Faraday will normalize the results and share them with the rest of the team in real-time. Faraday has more than 60 plugins available (and counting), including the most popular commercial and open-source tools. If you use a tool that Faraday doesn't have a plugin for, you can create your own! During this presentation we're going to release Faraday v3.0 with all the new features that we were working on for the last couple of months that include a huge back-end change. Come check it out!

                Nearly every penetration test begins the same way - run a NMAP scan, review the results, choose interesting services to enumerate and attack/exploit, and perform post-exploitation activities. What was once a fairly time consuming manual process, is now automated! Automated Penetration Testing Toolkit (APT2) is an extendable modular framework designed to automate common tasks performed during penetration testing. APT2 can chain data gathered from different modules together to build dynamic attack paths. Starting with a NMAP scan of the target environment, discovered ports and services become triggers for the various modules which in turn can fire additional triggers. Have FTP, Telnet, or SSH? APT2 will attempt common authentication. Have SMB? APT2 determines what OS and looks for shares, null sessions, and other information. Modules include everything from enumeration, scanning, brute forcing, and even integration with Metasploit. Come check out how APT2 will save you time on every engagement.Have you seen APT2 before? Great, now come and check out some of the new and enhanced features which include stream lined operations, additional modules, and improvements to the overall ease of module creation and development.

                Ever needed to pentest a network with 10 gazillion hosts with a very limited time frame? Ever wanted to Mimikatz entire subnets? How about shelling entire subnets? How about dumping SAM hashes? Share spidering? Keeping track of all the credentials you pillaged? (The list goes on)! All while doing this in the stealthiest way possible? Look no further than CrackMapExec! CrackMapExec (a.k.a CME) is a modular post-exploitation tool written in Python that helps automate assessing the security of *large* Active Directory networks. Built with stealth in mind, CME follows the concept of "Living off the Land": abusing built-in Active Directory features/protocols to achieve it's functionality and allowing it to evade most endpoint protection, IDS and IPS solutions. Although meant to be used primarily for offensive purposes, CME can be used by blue teams as well to assess account privileges, find misconfigurations and simulate attack scenarios. In this demo, the author will be showing off v4.0, a major update to the tool bringing more feature and capabilities than ever before! If you are interested in the latest and greatest Active Directory attacks/techniques, weaponizing them at scale and general cool AD stuff this is the demo for you!

                The Firmware Analysis and Comparison Tool (FACT) is intended to automate Firmware Security analysis. Thereby, it shall be easy to use (web GUI), extend (plug-in system) and integrate (REST API). When analyzing Firmware, you face several challenges: unpacking, initial analysis, identifying changes towards other versions, find other firmware images that might share vulnerabilities you just found. FACT is able to automate many aspects of these challenges leading to a massive speedup in the firmware analysis process. This means you can focus on the fun part of finding new vulnerabilities, whereas FACT does all the boring stuff for you.Source code: https://protect-eu.mimecast.com/s/FefbCNL66FZqmPNsmynnm?domain=github.comAdditional information: https://protect-eu.mimecast.com/s/siORCOM00sNLmZACv-Iml?domain=fkie-cad.github.io
